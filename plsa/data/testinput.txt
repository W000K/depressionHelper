I’ve been to a psychologist, I tell him my problems and his suggestions aren’t realistic. He even asks questions that hint that he knows I’ve made a bad mistake that has fucked me over. I already know that I won’t find peace or happiness. I will always suffer with the thought of how I could’ve been so much more. I do not want to live a life of just working and struggling to pay for things. I don’t want to live I life I do not enjoy or I’m not happy with. I am overly ambitious and this is something hard wired in my brain. To say that things will get better is such an empty statement. It is so false and it is just something literally ANYBODY says to a depressed person just to keep them going because there is no real solution or proper fix. It is just to keep us going. I don’t want to say it is wrong to say this, but to me it feels selfish to not acknowledge real problems and suffering of a person because apparently in time it will improve? You hear success stories of how people make it through and are happy they kept pushing, but so many people live years if not decades just to suffer more. Success stories are from people who had something they could work toward, an achievable dream that just needed hard work. Some people don’t have a goal anymore, like me. Their dreams have surpassed them. There is no valid point in living on if you have nothing to live for.
