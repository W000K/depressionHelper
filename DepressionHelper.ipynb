I say all of this to hopefully help others realize they are not alone in this fight. To seek help get out of the house or do something at a time when this disease feels like a huge unbearable weight on top your chest. Do not give up hope!

      "If you grow up with someone, you don’t notice them changing until you look at photos of them in the past. If you live with someone who goes to the gym; you may not notice their incremental gains until a situation arises whereby their physique is put into question (i.e - them trying on a new shirt).The same applies for your mind; you’ve grown up with your mind since birth, and into your adulthood. In the same way you don’t notice the people you see everyday changing; you’ve probably never paid attention to the wisdom you’ve accumulated over the years and just how much you’ve changed. You aren’t the same as you were yesterday and you’ll be different tomorrow, wiser. For instance, last night I was turned away from a club because I was “dressed too casual”. This morning; I’ve woken up with knowledge that the club in question has a dress code which I didn’t meet, I’m now wiser. \n"

To be honest, I thought that's how the rest of my life was going to be. Down and out no matter what. Suicidal ideation, self harm, the works.

See, everyone else always told me it was just treatment resistant depression and that was that.

I'm bipolar!! Type 2 to be specific with a tendency toward depression as opposed to mania. That's why nothing was ever working. 30 years of barking up the wrong tree!  Believe me, I was not happy about the news at first: \"What the fuck do you mean I'm bipolar? Have you not been listening to me this while time?\" The signs were there: good grades that dropped way off as a younger person despite ability, a low tolerance for those I didn't like, a very short fuse, overall intensity, crudeness, and so much more. But how would I have known? Everyone else just said I was depressed and a little weird. I never really questioned it. I'm on a pretty heavy mood stabilizer now and have been for a couple months.

      "Just over six years ago, my baby brother was murdered. He wasn't really my baby brother. He was twenty. But he was my little brother. To be fair, he was my *younger* brother -- he was taller than me. So, I guess in a way, he was my big brother. Anyway, my baby brother, he was killed back in 2012. And I have to tell you, that experience really affected me. All the color drained out from the world. All my belief in everything about how everything was going to be okay in the end? That changed. All that stuff about how so-and-so loves you, and how all the bad people go one way and the good people go the other? I don't really know how I feel about that anymore. I learned that the world isn't a fair place. Cause if anyone should have died that day, it would've been me; not my baby brother. I loved that kid. I didn't know how much I loved him then.

Knowing the dark, but following the light, that is how I visualize overcoming depression. So, yes, every day is a new fight... but (and I'm quoting Attack on Titan here, my favorite show): \"If you win, live... If you lose, you die...

People like us don't just accept what's handed to us like sheep. There's no place for free  thinkers in this world. That's fine. We don't need to be approved. We never were. We just have to carve our names on this world before we go, like scars that cannot be hidden. Live. Fight. Survive. And leave your mark for all to see. I don't believe in religion but death comes for us all, and I truly believe that what we do if this life will impact the next if there is one. What that next life will be we can never discover. So you can't argue that your actions now won't affect that life. One thing I know we can carry on is our conscious. Maybe what we learn from this life will have worth there. \n",

      "Connection often times is one of the most palpable, healing and significant forms of impact that can be found. As one person once told me, 'your tribe knows your vibe.' Whether in person or online, having connection via them, even if they are communities just composed of a few good friends, can be invaluable. As Maya Angelou once said, 'You may forget what a person said to you, what you did with them, but you will never forget how they made you feel'. Like how some migrarial birds such as geese fly in a v and rotate, taking turns flying a the very front of the formation to break and take on the majority of the wind's resistance, in life the world becomes a lot less darker, a lot less harder, when we have others to share it with through the good and the bad. \n",

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",

      "It's very difficult, if not nearly impossible, to convince someone/\\[you\\] that they are flat out wrong. Our minds will go to extreme lengths to always be right because it's counterintuitive to tell ourselves otherwise.  I’m not referring to situations where its socially acceptable to “be wrong” and its encouraged to think alternatively as such in discussions or debates. I’m referring to situations whereby we are alone. We spend most of our time alone. I can’t think of any logical reason as to why anyone, in their solitude, would spend time trying to convince themselves against a belief they *already* have. I legitimately believe that *Kendrick Lamar* is better rapper than *Lil Pump*. I have no reason, in solitude, and with no one around, to spend time comparing the two and trying to make a strong argument for *Lil Pump* being the better rapper. I simply wouldn’t do that because my mind was made up a long time ago, and the only time I’ll revisit that belief, is if it comes up in conversation on or offline. \n",

Seriously it made my stepmom look lowkey by comparison. Literally every minute of my life was structure there and I hated it. But after awhile I didn’t hate it as much. And then stuff I was hearing in therapy there started making sense to me. I figured out that the family teachers (that’s what they call the house moms at Eva Carlston) were actually decent if I wasn’t being a total brat to them. Yeah, I still think their family meetings are dumb but I got to spend a lot of time in the art room and I learned how to play guitar some (I still remember how to play most of Roar :-D). I started working out too, which I know helped me so much.

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

      "Equally; when I’ve left food outside the fridge, its gone off. Even if you haven’t personally measured this phenomena; its probable that at some stage in your life you were *told* that leaving food outside means it will go off. You believe this to be real and have no immediate reason to question it. It's not contentious. We can objectively confirm this belief by comparing food in and out of a fridge and checking how quickly microbes and bacteria spread. Some beliefs can be measured; yet some, are more subjective. For instance; *forks*. In China, people believe that the most optimal way to eat noodles in through *chopsticks*. Why is this? Why when presented with a very similar food, people have different beliefs on the best way to consume it? I mean - it's not like spaghetti is massively different to noodles so why don't we largely use chopsticks to eat Spaghetti in Europe or the US? And why aren’t people in China or Japan largely eating noodles with forks? I’ve specifically used this example to highlight that some beliefs aren’t necessarily right or wrong. We just don't question them because they aren't immediately contentious in the societies we are part of. \n",

Kids used to call me weird, or didn't even bother to speak to me. But in all honesty, neither did I. I couldn't explain it, I just felt off. Scared to talk to anybody other than my parents or my brother. Everybody thought I was just shy, that it will pass. When I was a teenager I developed some serious anger issues. It came ti the point that I considered to hurt my family. I won't write about this part online because I did things that I regret to this day, even though my mom and brother forgave me.

To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n"

That means everywhere I go it will go with me. What hope is there to be free, then? But if I realize that it's on the outside wanting to get in, then I can treat it like I would a common thief trying to break into my house to steal my things, hurt my family and kill me.

      "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on changing the way a person thinks through guided exercises to address the root of aberrant behaviors. A huge part of this technique is first identifying that a problem exists, addressing the problem, and in doing so, hopefully alleviate the symptoms associated with the problem. I am new to therapy, admittedly, but my therapist has already started CBT with me. When my therapist pointed out my faulty thinking and gave it a name, I was able to recognize that this was not normal. Now we are in the process of changing the way I think about myself. It is not something that I expect to happen overnight. It took years of beating myself up to get to the point where I even considered therapy as an option. So, I fully anticipate the great time and effort I’ll need to invest in this healing process. I’ve started by doing more of the things that make me happy, like writing. Writing has always been cathartic for me and helps me organize and recognize fallacies in my thought process. It’s why I started this blog. I’ve written diaries, poetry, journals, articles, short stories, and I think I’m damned good at it (though my cognitive distortions sometimes tell me otherwise). Obviously, CBT is highly personal for everyone. Writing is good for me but might send someone else into a full-blown panic attack. So, I will end here hoping that if you recognize yourself in anything I’ve written here, or even if you don’t but have other concerns, seek out therapy. There is no shame in admitting when you need help. It takes a lot of strength to do this, and I think we probably all need therapy from time to time, because nobody lives a perfect, happy life (and honestly it sounds kind of boring). We all encounter bumps in the road, and when we do, it's important to have the skill-set to respond in a healthy manner. The stigma of feeling like a failure, weak, and inadequate for having to seek out therapy, all of which I’ve held myself, is just that, a stigma. Dispel it, dispel the cognitive distortions, dispel the doubt, and work towards a better, healthier you.  \n",

      "I mentioned from my experience in high school about hurting myself, and that urge to hurt myself returned yet again. I did it enough times to drive my boyfriend crazy. I was putting weight on him to be responsible for me, and eventually he had to call the police in fear that I’d go too far. The police comes and I get forced into the ER and admitted to the psychiatric ward. If any of you all have been to one of those, you’ll understand that it’s one of the worst places to find yourself. It’s not fun. They take your cell phones and basically all of your freedom. You get the help you need faster, but it’s still a miserable experience. Not only that, but I was scared shitless as there were individuals there that were a threat to me. One guy had to be watched by two people at a time to ensure that he doesn’t try to hurt someone else (because apparently he had a history of that in the facility). \n"

I'm going to go to the others that you torment and I'm going to tell them what I learned about how you work, and I'm going to teach them how to conquer you, too.

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",
      "1. Personification: I am being very intentional about externalizing the issue. It's usually the opposite that's taught. Internalize it, \"accept that it's a part of who you are and always will be.\" If it's a part of who I am, I'm fucked, because I'm always going to be who I am. That means everywhere I go it will go with me. What hope is there to be free, then? But if I realize that it's on the outside wanting to get in, then I can treat it like I would a common thief trying to break into my house to steal my things, hurt my family and kill me. Because that is what these mental health issues exist to do, their only goal is to kill.\n",

      "Healing from emotional wounds takes action, but I often get stuck in the  fear or laziness of taking that first step - even though I know I'd  feel way better if I did something. It's good to remind myself that  inner conflicts don't just go away, they require communication, therapy,  totally changing my life by moving or traveling, meditating, finding  forgiveness, eating differently - they require me to take action. I want  to feel good in this life, so I do the work on the road to recovery.  And I can't just try once and then give up, I have to keep going and  trust that working through the initial discomfort will eventually lead  to feeling better. Sometimes multiple conversations are needed,  sometimes switching therapists or trying multiple jobs is necessary -  the healing is there, it just takes effort. \n",

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",
      "Yesterday I had a deep cleaning with a new dentist in the medical office I work in. She continuously complimented me on my flossing and how well I’ve been taking care of my teeth.

Recovery is never linear but in this moment I feel like I can conquer anything.  \n",
      "If depression sneaks in and lays me out, I can still believe I’m a king, even if I don’t feel like one, even if I'm failing to act like it. If a person I was hoping would approve of me doesn’t? I can still say, despite the knot I might be feeling in my chest over rejection, *“You know what? That’s okay, I’m still a king!”* And you wish them well and move on, knowing nothing about who you are has changed, and more importantly, they didn’t have the power to take any of it away.\n",
      "The same is true for feelings. Not that feelings are bad, but they can be very unpredictable. That makes them unreliable for building sustainable structures on. I don’t want to build the foundation of my identity on how I feel, or on the approval of another person, because I’m not guaranteed to feel that way tomorrow, and that person isn’t guaranteed to still approve of me in the morning. \n"

He never realizes he is part of that and therefore whatever he does,whatever that is,even if it is the best action(exercise etc) he then will come home and the cycle(slightly modified) will always stay there as long as the thinker is separate from his thought.

When your crush hooks up with someone else and she doesn't even know you exist,and you're all sour and sad, it doesn't mean you aren't loved, not even by your parents, Jesus will always love you. If you ever think of suicide, you need to know that you will never solve your problems by vanishing, you must fight for this life,because it is the greatest gift ,even if it seems to be sometimes a burdon, your suffering will be awarded in the afterlife.

Today my wife and I saw a counsellor for our marriage.  We will be seeing the counsellor individually as well for our own personal issues in addition to our marital struggles.  I've never sought counseling in the past though I've been keenly aware that it was needed in my life.  While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.

Her and my grandpa got into a big discussion about it because he wasn’t happy she brought me back from the horse farm. They sent me to a therapist who said I needed meds for depression. When I said I didn’t want meds, the therapist convinced them to send me to another residential treatment program for girls. They agreed to pay for it but they didn’t want it to be too far away this time so they could check up on me more. They wouldn’t tell me where they were sending me but my imagination kicked into high gear. I almost ran away the night before I was supposed to go. This was two months after I my 16th and all I wanted to do was escape my life and whatever hell I was going to this time. I also seriously thought about doing something way worse that night.\n",

To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",

Scared to talk to anybody other than my parents or my brother. Everybody thought I was just shy, that it will pass. When I was a teenager I developed some serious anger issues. It came ti the point that I considered to hurt my family. I won't write about this part online because I did things that I regret to this day, even though my mom and brother forgave me.

The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself.

Thank you again!/nwatch this before you give up {4K}/nRemember: you aren’t alone and you have purpose.Here’s to the people who want to die. To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",

I don’t know why she had an attitude with me but, looking back, I think she was mad I didn’t go live with my mom. Anyway, I starting getting depression and anxiety about it. Things kept getting worse and I went down that path you always hear about, skipping school, hanging out with friends instead of going home, partying, picking fights and generally being a mood whenever I did go home. I picked fights with my stepmom just because I felt like it and she even called the cops on me a couple times. \n",

This time around, I think I'm going to do my best to stick with this, even when I'm feeling well. Maybe that will make it harder for me to fall into depression. Maybe it'll make me feel more resilient. I took a DBT outpatient program years ago, and I really liked the worksheets, but found that I wish they were a little customizable.\n",

      "I was feeling really guilty this morning for what I have been putting my loved ones through. I almost fell back to where I was a couple of nights ago. But instead, I got out of bed, and just took a shower. Now I’m laying in my moms bed. I haven’t said anything to her. But I’m feeling a lot better now. And I was able to avoid the longing to end my life.  \n",
      "Let’s say my totem is a hair-tie from a girlfriend, and every time I feel unloved, I look at that hair-tie and it reminds me *“Hey, regardless of what I’m feeling, I know I’m loved because this girl loves me!”* Well, what happens if we have a bad break up? That Totem immediately goes from being a secure foundation to keep me grounded in positive thinking to becoming the meteor that destroys my entire house with negativity and insecurity. So I'm using foresight to say, *\"maybe not the best foundation to live upon!* Every time I see that hair-tie from then on I know I risk giving room to think that maybe I’m not really lovable or worth anything, because if I was why didn’t it work out? Why did she stop wanting me?\n",

      "Back to my current situation with my boyfriend. We’re young. We’re 20 and I’m in college. We don’t want to somehow end up with a child that we could barely take care of. I had an IUD and it expelled itself, so I had to switch to the birth control implant, and it made my depression worse. I don’t believe it caused it entirely, but it damn sure didn’t help it. From then on, things got bad. However, I didn’t feel like I had the option to get it taken out because of my situation. I’m too poor to visit the doctor every few months for new prescriptions due to a high copay and out of pocket expense for filling prescriptions. I have to finish school, and I was essentially out of feasible options, so I had to cope with that dilemma. \n",

I was putting weight on him to be responsible for me, and eventually he had to call the police in fear that I’d go too far. The police comes and I get forced into the ER and admitted to the psychiatric ward. If any of you all have been to one of those, you’ll understand that it’s one of the worst places to find yourself. It’s not fun. They take your cell phones and basically all of your freedom. You get the help you need faster, but it’s still a miserable experience.

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",
      "The same is true for feelings. Not that feelings are bad, but they can be very unpredictable. That makes them unreliable for building sustainable structures on.

You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this.

She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",

      "If you're feeling bad, like nobody cares about you, you need to know that you are LOVED. Love is one of the most beautiful things that exist. Love is everywhere. Love is an energy, so are we. If you feel let down ,or depressed, you need to know that even if you can't see it, love is always there. When your crush hooks up with someone else and she doesn't even know you exist,and you're all sour and sad, it doesn't mean you aren't loved, not even by your parents, Jesus will always love you. If you ever think of suicide, you need to know that you will never solve your problems by vanishing, you must fight for this life,because it is the greatest gift ,even if it seems to be sometimes a burdon, your suffering will be awarded in the afterlife.

Today my wife and I saw a counsellor for our marriage.  We will be seeing the counsellor individually as well for our own personal issues in addition to our marital struggles.  I've never sought counseling in the past though I've been keenly aware that it was needed in my life.  While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.

      "Sometimes life can feel overwhelming, like everything is too much and you aren't enough or don't want to continue on for whatever reasons, but you have a whole narrative of a life to live and share with others, so much you can do, be apart of and share in. In everyone you interact with and those who interact with you, there is no one quite like you, that has the same thoughts, opinions, view, sense of humor, or character, and that makes you individually unique. That individuality is what makes you uniquely beautiful in your own ways and what makes what you have to offer others and share with others a commodity and value that won't quite be found anywhere else or with anyone else.\n",

I had an IUD and it expelled itself, so I had to switch to the birth control implant, and it made my depression worse. I don’t believe it caused it entirely, but it damn sure didn’t help it. From then on, things got bad. However, I didn’t feel like I had the option to get it taken out because of my situation. I’m too poor to visit the doctor every few months for new prescriptions due to a high copay and out of pocket expense for filling prescriptions. I have to finish school, and I was essentially out of feasible options, so I had to cope with that dilemma. \n",

I mostly lurk and see what advice is given and hope its applicable to me, but today I wanted to share the next step in my recovery with everyone. My life has been full of ups and downs, but mostly it has been downs. If you are interested in all that you can check out my first post, because this is going to be a positive one. During my period of absence, I have overcame my alcohol addiction and am proud to say I am 9 months sober. I have started therapy to deal with the emotional trauma I experienced throughout my life and have been told I am doing very well. I have also been prescribed medication to help with my depression and insomnia. It was not an easy journey by any means, but it is one that I am glad to have started and look forward to finishing. I guess my point would be that no matter how bad the situation you are in may be, remember that the only way it can get better is to keep moving forward. When you choice to end your life you are not stopping the pain, you are merely moving it to your loved ones. I hope this can inspire at least one person to take that first step and find help where they need it. And if you ever feel like you need someone to talk to, feel free to message me.

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",

      "A friend of mine is always sympathetic and I didn't really realize until looking up the definition why her words felt so distant and unmeaningful. Know the difference so you can support your loved ones! Empathy  typically provides far more support and healing for a person than sympathy does. Compassion is another step above sympathy or empathy in that it  directly offers support, \"how can I help you?\" Sympathy, empathy, and  compassion may all be combined together such as with, \"I'm sorry you're  feeling that way, I went through a similar thing recently and feel your pain, how can I help?\" Sympathy by itself is not necessarily bad, it  just often comes off as distant even though the person giving it may care a lot.

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",

Believe me, I was not happy about the news at first: \"What the fuck do you mean I'm bipolar? Have you not been listening to me this while time?\" The signs were there: good grades that dropped way off as a younger person despite ability, a low tolerance for those I didn't like, a very short fuse, overall intensity, crudeness, and so much more.

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",

Something to look forward to on the other end, an anchor of sorts that you can grab onto and let it pull you back up to the surface.\n"

      "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on changing the way a person thinks through guided exercises to address the root of aberrant behaviors. A huge part of this technique is first identifying that a problem exists, addressing the problem, and in doing so, hopefully alleviate the symptoms associated with the problem. I am new to therapy, admittedly, but my therapist has already started CBT with me. When my therapist pointed out my faulty thinking and gave it a name, I was able to recognize that this was not normal. Now we are in the process of changing the way I think about myself. It is not something that I expect to happen overnight. It took years of beating myself up to get to the point where I even considered therapy as an option. So, I fully anticipate the great time and effort I’ll need to invest in this healing process. I’ve started by doing more of the things that make me happy, like writing. Writing has always been cathartic for me and helps me organize and recognize fallacies in my thought process. It’s why I started this blog. I’ve written diaries, poetry, journals, articles, short stories, and I think I’m damned good at it (though my cognitive distortions sometimes tell me otherwise). Obviously, CBT is highly personal for everyone. Writing is good for me but might send someone else into a full-blown panic attack. So, I will end here hoping that if you recognize yourself in anything I’ve written here, or even if you don’t but have other concerns, seek out therapy. There is no shame in admitting when you need help. It takes a lot of strength to do this, and I think we probably all need therapy from time to time, because nobody lives a perfect, happy life (and honestly it sounds kind of boring). We all encounter bumps in the road, and when we do, it's important to have the skill-set to respond in a healthy manner. The stigma of feeling like a failure, weak, and inadequate for having to seek out therapy, all of which I’ve held myself, is just that, a stigma. Dispel it, dispel the cognitive distortions, dispel the doubt, and work towards a better, healthier you.  \n",

If you ever think of suicide, you need to know that you will never solve your problems by vanishing, you must fight for this life,because it is the greatest gift ,even if it seems to be sometimes a burdon, your suffering will be awarded in the afterlife. Never give up. YOU ARE LOVED. There will always be hope. Be strong guys, be strong. Peace./nPatience/nGo Get Help.I'm at the beginning of my journey for healing and health.  Today my wife and I saw a counsellor for our marriage.  We will be seeing the counsellor individually as well for our own personal issues in addition to our marital struggles.  I've never sought counseling in the past though I've been keenly aware that it was needed in my life.  While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.

The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself.

Think about it; if a 12 year old comes up to you and said *“You should be married by the age of 30, own this property, have x amount of children, own this type of car and earn x amount of money”* \\- You may think “F\\*\\*k off - what do you know?”.

I don’t know if this happened to anyone else, but for an extremely long time, I left it untreated, and then it got worse, and around the same time that it was worsening, I had met this really amazing guy. He’s been extremely supportive and understanding with this illness, in ways that most people can’t be. I’m sure other people can relate to this: it’s extremely hard to maintain a healthy relationship while suffering from depression and not getting the proper treatment.

The police comes and I get forced into the ER and admitted to the psychiatric ward. If any of you all have been to one of those, you’ll understand that it’s one of the worst places to find yourself. It’s not fun. They take your cell phones and basically all of your freedom. You get the help you need faster, but it’s still a miserable experience.

      "If you grow up with someone, you don’t notice them changing until you look at photos of them in the past. If you live with someone who goes to the gym; you may not notice their incremental gains until a situation arises whereby their physique is put into question (i.e - them trying on a new shirt).The same applies for your mind; you’ve grown up with your mind since birth, and into your adulthood. In the same way you don’t notice the people you see everyday changing; you’ve probably never paid attention to the wisdom you’ve accumulated over the years and just how much you’ve changed. You aren’t the same as you were yesterday and you’ll be different tomorrow, wiser. For instance, last night I was turned away from a club because I was “dressed too casual”.

I say all of this to hopefully help others realize they are not alone in this fight. To seek help get out of the house or do something at a time when this disease feels like a huge unbearable weight on top your chest. Do not give up hope!

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",

In everyone you interact with and those who interact with you, there is no one quite like you, that has the same thoughts, opinions, view, sense of humor, or character, and that makes you individually unique. That individuality is what makes you uniquely beautiful in your own ways and what makes what you have to offer others and share with others a commodity and value that won't quite be found anywhere else or with anyone else.\n",

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n"

I mostly lurk and see what advice is given and hope its applicable to me, but today I wanted to share the next step in my recovery with everyone. My life has been full of ups and downs, but mostly it has been downs. If you are interested in all that you can check out my first post, because this is going to be a positive one. During my period of absence, I have overcame my alcohol addiction and am proud to say I am 9 months sober. I have started therapy to deal with the emotional trauma I experienced throughout my life and have been told I am doing very well. I have also been prescribed medication to help with my depression and insomnia. It was not an easy journey by any means, but it is one that I am glad to have started and look forward to finishing. I guess my point would be that no matter how bad the situation you are in may be, remember that the only way it can get better is to keep moving forward. When you choice to end your life you are not stopping the pain, you are merely moving it to your loved ones.

Today my wife and I saw a counsellor for our marriage.  We will be seeing the counsellor individually as well for our own personal issues in addition to our marital struggles.  I've never sought counseling in the past though I've been keenly aware that it was needed in my life.  While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.

To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n"

I went through some horrible things and had to do things to keep myself going. I was clouded by fear and emptyness I just kept tripping and falling g deeper. I then proceeded to try to commit Suicide by OD and failed. Doctor said if I had 5 more mg it would've done it. But he said \"You may be dead right now mentally but your body physically fought to live. Showing that you can still find peace\" Which changed me. IT MADE ME FEEL EMOTION. IT MADE ME SMILE. IT MADE ME REBIRTH INTO WHAT I AM NOW. I still have dark times but I know I can always get up and Fuck the World.

On my journey, I walked past new strangers, I took a new route, and everything which happened was happening for the first time - I’m now wiser. You are the wisest you’ve ever been and will carry on to be so. That being said, why should you hold yourself to the expectations you gave yourself when you were less wise? Think about it; if a 12 year old comes up to you and said *“You should be married by the age of 30, own this property, have x amount of children, own this type of car and earn x amount of money”* \\- You may think “F\\*\\*k off - what do you know?”. You wouldn't hold yourself to that 12 year old’s expectations so why are we insistent on holding on to some of the expectations we created when were younger? Its okay to have expectations of yourself, however; it’s not okay to suffocate yourself because of them.\n",

      "Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.\n",

I mostly lurk and see what advice is given and hope its applicable to me, but today I wanted to share the next step in my recovery with everyone. My life has been full of ups and downs, but mostly it has been downs. If you are interested in all that you can check out my first post, because this is going to be a positive one. During my period of absence, I have overcame my alcohol addiction and am proud to say I am 9 months sober. I have started therapy to deal with the emotional trauma I experienced throughout my life and have been told I am doing very well. I have also been prescribed medication to help with my depression and insomnia. It was not an easy journey by any means, but it is one that I am glad to have started and look forward to finishing. I guess my point would be that no matter how bad the situation you are in may be, remember that the only way it can get better is to keep moving forward. When you choice to end your life you are not stopping the pain, you are merely moving it to your loved ones. I hope this can inspire at least one person to take that first step and find help where they need it. And if you ever feel like you need someone to talk to, feel free to message me.

He’s been extremely supportive and understanding with this illness, in ways that most people can’t be. I’m sure other people can relate to this: it’s extremely hard to maintain a healthy relationship while suffering from depression and not getting the proper treatment.

I don’t know why she had an attitude with me but, looking back, I think she was mad I didn’t go live with my mom. Anyway, I starting getting depression and anxiety about it. Things kept getting worse and I went down that path you always hear about, skipping school, hanging out with friends instead of going home, partying, picking fights and generally being a mood whenever I did go home. I picked fights with my stepmom just because I felt like it and she even called the cops on me a couple times. \n"

Even if you haven’t personally measured this phenomena; its probable that at some stage in your life you were *told* that leaving food outside means it will go off.

For instance; *forks*. In China, people believe that the most optimal way to eat noodles in through *chopsticks*. Why is this? Why when presented with a very similar food, people have different beliefs on the best way to consume it? I mean - it's not like spaghetti is massively different to noodles so why don't we largely use chopsticks to eat Spaghetti in Europe or the US? And why aren’t people in China or Japan largely eating noodles with forks? I’ve specifically used this example to highlight that some beliefs aren’t necessarily right or wrong.

The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself.

      "I've heard people say that some people know when they are going to die, and you can see it in their eyes. That's how I felt after dealing with it for so long.

      "I’m so happy that I wanted to share my excitement with someone. But no one else would understand how something so small could mean so much to someone like me. Thank you again!/nwatch this before you give up {4K}/nRemember: you aren’t alone and you have purpose.Here’s to the people who want to die. To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",
      "If my head is full of suicidal thoughts? I’ve already decided in the times of peace that I will stay alive just to irritate the shit out of Death. When it comes whispering in my ear, *“Just roll over and die! You wouldn’t have to feel this way anymore if you weren’t alive! It’ll be over before you know it! People will only be sad about it for a little bit, and then they’ll move on!”* I’ve already decided, *“Whatever you are, you sure seem to want me out of here real bad. I bet you’re even a little pissed off, maybe even scared every second I’m still alive… so you know what? I’m going to stay alive just to annoy you, just to torment you the way you’ve tormented me, just to keep that power over you that you wish you had over me. Thanks for giving me a reason and a purpose to live.\"*\n",
      "Healing from emotional wounds takes action, but I often get stuck in the  fear or laziness of taking that first step - even though I know I'd  feel way better if I did something. It's good to remind myself that  inner conflicts don't just go away, they require communication, therapy,  totally changing my life by moving or traveling, meditating, finding  forgiveness, eating differently - they require me to take action. I want  to feel good in this life, so I do the work on the road to recovery.  And I can't just try once and then give up, I have to keep going and  trust that working through the initial discomfort will eventually lead  to feeling better. Sometimes multiple conversations are needed,  sometimes switching therapists or trying multiple jobs is necessary -  the healing is there, it just takes effort. \n",

      "I generally stick with a format/template for a few months, and then when I emerge out of my depression, I find I need it less and less. I eventually drop it, because I don't need it anymore. Then I get depressed again. Then I start up with a new format (I've cycled through about 10 so far) and work my way out of depression again. This time around, I think I'm going to do my best to stick with this, even when I'm feeling well. Maybe that will make it harder for me to fall into depression. Maybe it'll make me feel more resilient. I took a DBT outpatient program years ago, and I really liked the worksheets, but found that I wish they were a little customizable.\n",

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

Knowing the dark, but following the light, that is how I visualize overcoming depression. So, yes, every day is a new fight... but (and I'm quoting Attack on Titan here, my favorite show): \"If you win, live... If you lose, you die... But if you don't fight, you can't win.\" Anyway, I think everyone suffering from depression (I have Bipolar II), would benefit from creating their own fighting mantra that sends them confidently into the fray... and then into the light./nGuidance & Emergence EP | Underground Music (HELP WITH DEPRESSION, LOSS OF MOTIVATION, SELF REFLECTION)/nThe Science of Solitude and How “Digital Minimalism” Can Help with Anxiety and Depression/nI wrote this when i was spiraling.

On my journey, I walked past new strangers, I took a new route, and everything which happened was happening for the first time - I’m now wiser. You are the wisest you’ve ever been and will carry on to be so. That being said, why should you hold yourself to the expectations you gave yourself when you were less wise? Think about it; if a 12 year old comes up to you and said *“You should be married by the age of 30, own this property, have x amount of children, own this type of car and earn x amount of money”* \\- You may think “F\\*\\*k off - what do you know?”.

I know listening has helped me feel a little better when I'm down./nFeeling positive..So I posted a couple months ago about how I finally called to make an appointment to get into therapy. I've had two appointments so far and this time I mentioned that I'm literally a crazy person before my period. my therapist mentioned PMDD and we read the definition in the DSM-5 and I'm like pretty positive that's what I have.

      "1. Personification: I am being very intentional about externalizing the issue. It's usually the opposite that's taught. Internalize it, \"accept that it's a part of who you are and always will be.\" If it's a part of who I am, I'm fucked, because I'm always going to be who I am. That means everywhere I go it will go with me. What hope is there to be free, then? But if I realize that it's on the outside wanting to get in, then I can treat it like I would a common thief trying to break into my house to steal my things, hurt my family and kill me. Because that is what these mental health issues exist to do, their only goal is to kill.\n",

Thank you again!/nwatch this before you give up {4K}/nRemember: you aren’t alone and you have purpose.Here’s to the people who want to die. To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",

That's why I started my own sub where active research is being posted myself and others like me. Can easily be found through my info. I love the idea of having people like me actively researching themselves to get to the bottom of it, rather than just settle and suffer.

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",
      "So we are learning to strengthen ourselves on strong foundations, instead of foundations like feelings, moods, relationships, other people's opinions, and things that are constantly shifting from day to day, moment to moment.

And then stuff I was hearing in therapy there started making sense to me. I figured out that the family teachers (that’s what they call the house moms at Eva Carlston) were actually decent if I wasn’t being a total brat to them. Yeah, I still think their family meetings are dumb but I got to spend a lot of time in the art room and I learned how to play guitar some (I still remember how to play most of Roar :-D). I started working out too, which I know helped me so much.

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",

If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.

She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too.

Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.

I really do love you people on this sub. Please find the courage to reach out for validity and encouragement when you need it, you deserve it! I’m not the best redditor, but if you need to message someone, I’m here. I will listen and i will do my best to get back to you with more thoughtful words of love./nStarting to feel a little better/nthis makes me feel good, hope it does you/nBe comfortable with the uncomfortable/nSome thoughts regarding depressionNot too long ago, I felt the surprising conviction to reply to someone who had composed a post regarding their depression and shared some thoughts I frequently remind myself of and use to help stave off my own depressive episodes whenever they arise. For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n"

      "I’m so happy that I wanted to share my excitement with someone. But no one else would understand how something so small could mean so much to someone like me. Thank you again!/nwatch this before you give up {4K}/nRemember: you aren’t alone and you have purpose.Here’s to the people who want to die. To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",

      "It's very difficult, if not nearly impossible, to convince someone/\\[you\\] that they are flat out wrong. Our minds will go to extreme lengths to always be right because it's counterintuitive to tell ourselves otherwise.  I’m not referring to situations where its socially acceptable to “be wrong” and its encouraged to think alternatively as such in discussions or debates. I’m referring to situations whereby we are alone. We spend most of our time alone. I can’t think of any logical reason as to why anyone, in their solitude, would spend time trying to convince themselves against a belief they *already* have. I legitimately believe that *Kendrick Lamar* is better rapper than *Lil Pump*. I have no reason, in solitude, and with no one around, to spend time comparing the two and trying to make a strong argument for *Lil Pump* being the better rapper. I simply wouldn’t do that because my mind was made up a long time ago, and the only time I’ll revisit that belief, is if it comes up in conversation on or offline. \n",

Today my wife and I saw a counsellor for our marriage.  We will be seeing the counsellor individually as well for our own personal issues in addition to our marital struggles.

While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.

Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",

      "Long story short, I didn’t do anything stupid. They took me to a place called Eva Carlston Academy. At first, it seemed like total BS there because they had all these programs that I had to participate in and I had to live in a house with a bunch of other girls and a million BS rules. Seriously it made my stepmom look lowkey by comparison. Literally every minute of my life was structure there and I hated it. But after awhile I didn’t hate it as much. And then stuff I was hearing in therapy there started making sense to me. I figured out that the family teachers (that’s what they call the house moms at Eva Carlston) were actually decent if I wasn’t being a total brat to them. Yeah, I still think their family meetings are dumb but I got to spend a lot of time in the art room and I learned how to play guitar some (I still remember how to play most of Roar :-D). I started working out too, which I know helped me so much. (I’ve started getting into power lifting at UU but that’s another story) TBH I think the most important thing I got out of my time there was how respect effects peoples lives and how much we all deserve respect and owe it to others. \n",

You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.

It’s my choice to seek help. It’s my choice to go out and do things. I can choose to lie in bed all day being sad, or I can at least make the effort to help myself. It’s a hard truth to take in, and it took me forever to just accept for my own self, but truthfully, if you want to get better you have to somehow take control of your own life. Life is what you make it. You get to make decisions in your life, so don’t let an illness stop you from doing just that. \n",

I was putting weight on him to be responsible for me, and eventually he had to call the police in fear that I’d go too far. The police comes and I get forced into the ER and admitted to the psychiatric ward. If any of you all have been to one of those, you’ll understand that it’s one of the worst places to find yourself. It’s not fun. They take your cell phones and basically all of your freedom. You get the help you need faster, but it’s still a miserable experience. Not only that, but I was scared shitless as there were individuals there that were a threat to me. One guy had to be watched by two people at a time to ensure that he doesn’t try to hurt someone else (because apparently he had a history of that in the facility). \n"

      "Healing from emotional wounds takes action, but I often get stuck in the  fear or laziness of taking that first step - even though I know I'd  feel way better if I did something. It's good to remind myself that  inner conflicts don't just go away, they require communication, therapy,  totally changing my life by moving or traveling, meditating, finding  forgiveness, eating differently - they require me to take action. I want  to feel good in this life, so I do the work on the road to recovery.  And I can't just try once and then give up, I have to keep going and  trust that working through the initial discomfort will eventually lead  to feeling better.

She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too.

I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",
      "It doesn’t always make the intense thoughts and feelings disappear, but it pulls me out of that sense of drowning and insanity by reminding me that not everything I'm thinking and feeling is the true reality.\n",
      "If the thoughts and feelings have no power, that means you do. Do you know why bipolar, ptsd, depression, and all these things try so hard to get us to kill ourselves? Because they lack the power to do it for us. The whole goal is for us to be dead and gone, for the potential our life has to contribute something good to this world to be ripped away from history. But those things have no power to do it, so the only thing they can do is try to talk us into it, and pressure us with feelings, and scream at us through thoughts.\n",
      "I have dedicated my life to showing others how to identify the exact thing or set of things, that is keeping us stuck in Depression.  I am offering one free session and it is very possible it will be the only session you will ever need.  I want nothing from you but to see you feel better and if you decide to continue your progress, I will help you find support that matches your budget.\n"

Think about it; if a 12 year old comes up to you and said *“You should be married by the age of 30, own this property, have x amount of children, own this type of car and earn x amount of money”* \\- You may think “F\\*\\*k off - what do you know?”.

That Totem immediately goes from being a secure foundation to keep me grounded in positive thinking to becoming the meteor that destroys my entire house with negativity and insecurity.

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n"

I am also not so naive enough to ever believe that that I will ever fully understand the aches, torments, and darkness you often experience. I don’t know what your first thought is when you wake up; nor do I have the slightest clue of the thoughts you have on a day to day basis.

Knowing the dark, but following the light, that is how I visualize overcoming depression. So, yes, every day is a new fight... but (and I'm quoting Attack on Titan here, my favorite show): \"If you win, live... If you lose, you die... But if you don't fight, you can't win.\" Anyway, I think everyone suffering from depression (I have Bipolar II), would benefit from creating their own fighting mantra that sends them confidently into the fray... and then into the light./nGuidance & Emergence EP | Underground Music (HELP WITH DEPRESSION, LOSS OF MOTIVATION, SELF REFLECTION)/nThe Science of Solitude and How “Digital Minimalism” Can Help with Anxiety and Depression/nI wrote this when i was spiraling.

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",
      "The same is true for feelings. Not that feelings are bad, but they can be very unpredictable. That makes them unreliable for building sustainable structures on.

That’s okay, I’m still a king!”* And you wish them well and move on, knowing nothing about who you are has changed, and more importantly, they didn’t have the power to take any of it away.\n"

A lot of people make their big decisions under those feelings, and they don't know why they can't stay committed to things long-term. Often it's because you unknowingly made a motivational commitment in response that strong swell of emotion, so as soon as the emotion dies down so does your resolve and your motivation. Since your commitment was a reaction to the emotion it's easy to think the commitment isn't worth it if the work isn't generating that same emotion.\n",

I hold these beliefs because the immediate society im part of has given me tools to test these hypotheses. On large - they have all checked out.

      "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on changing the way a person thinks through guided exercises to address the root of aberrant behaviors. A huge part of this technique is first identifying that a problem exists, addressing the problem, and in doing so, hopefully alleviate the symptoms associated with the problem. I am new to therapy, admittedly, but my therapist has already started CBT with me. When my therapist pointed out my faulty thinking and gave it a name, I was able to recognize that this was not normal. Now we are in the process of changing the way I think about myself. It is not something that I expect to happen overnight. It took years of beating myself up to get to the point where I even considered therapy as an option. So, I fully anticipate the great time and effort I’ll need to invest in this healing process. I’ve started by doing more of the things that make me happy, like writing. Writing has always been cathartic for me and helps me organize and recognize fallacies in my thought process. It’s why I started this blog. I’ve written diaries, poetry, journals, articles, short stories, and I think I’m damned good at it (though my cognitive distortions sometimes tell me otherwise). Obviously, CBT is highly personal for everyone. Writing is good for me but might send someone else into a full-blown panic attack. So, I will end here hoping that if you recognize yourself in anything I’ve written here, or even if you don’t but have other concerns, seek out therapy. There is no shame in admitting when you need help. It takes a lot of strength to do this, and I think we probably all need therapy from time to time, because nobody lives a perfect, happy life (and honestly it sounds kind of boring). We all encounter bumps in the road, and when we do, it's important to have the skill-set to respond in a healthy manner. The stigma of feeling like a failure, weak, and inadequate for having to seek out therapy, all of which I’ve held myself, is just that, a stigma. Dispel it, dispel the cognitive distortions, dispel the doubt, and work towards a better, healthier you.  \n",

Because they lack the power to do it for us. The whole goal is for us to be dead and gone, for the potential our life has to contribute something good to this world to be ripped away from history. But those things have no power to do it, so the only thing they can do is try to talk us into it, and pressure us with feelings, and scream at us through thoughts.\n"

At first, it seemed like total BS there because they had all these programs that I had to participate in and I had to live in a house with a bunch of other girls and a million BS rules. Seriously it made my stepmom look lowkey by comparison. Literally every minute of my life was structure there and I hated it. But after awhile I didn’t hate it as much. And then stuff I was hearing in therapy there started making sense to me. I figured out that the family teachers (that’s what they call the house moms at Eva Carlston) were actually decent if I wasn’t being a total brat to them. Yeah, I still think their family meetings are dumb but I got to spend a lot of time in the art room and I learned how to play guitar some (I still remember how to play most of Roar :-D). I started working out too, which I know helped me so much.

      "I think, if you're still reading, you already know I never was able to fill that hole. Well, not with that stuff I already mentioned. And let me tell you: the fact that those things didn't fix the pain, that really, really messed with me. It didn't seem right. I really believed that drugs, alcohol, and whatever.. that kind of stuff could help me forget about the pain I was feeling.\n",
      "I'm not looking for sympathy here. I don't need it. All I'm asking is that you stay here for me, so I can stay here for you. Being able to help you helps me. If you stay for no else and nothing else.. please.. stay for me. Because I need you to need me.\n",
      "Medication  wasn’t an entire solution for me, but rather a head start towards being a better me. I think the biggest change in heart I had to wire my brain to believe is that my own happiness is nobody’s responsibility but my own. It’s my choice to make time to take care of my own mental health. It’s my choice to seek help. It’s my choice to go out and do things. I can choose to lie in bed all day being sad, or I can at least make the effort to help myself. It’s a hard truth to take in, and it took me forever to just accept for my own self, but truthfully, if you want to get better you have to somehow take control of your own life. Life is what you make it. You get to make decisions in your life, so don’t let an illness stop you from doing just that. \n",
      "Lastly, similar but converseive to how the world can be a lot brighter, more beautiful when shared with others, without yourself and what you either do or can mean and matter to others, the world will be a less bright without one more flame, one more light to help shine in the darkest of nights. So please stay, and please do not give up. You are meant to be here, wanted by the likes of me and many others, even if you may not always know it, and as one of my favorite likes from the Dead Poet's Society summarized that I opened up this message with, you really do have your own verse to contribute to the great play of life, both for yourself and others. \"/nThe next chapterIt's been a while since I have posted here. I mostly lurk and see what advice is given and hope its applicable to me, but today I wanted to share the next step in my recovery with everyone. My life has been full of ups and downs, but mostly it has been downs. If you are interested in all that you can check out my first post, because this is going to be a positive one. During my period of absence, I have overcame my alcohol addiction and am proud to say I am 9 months sober. I have started therapy to deal with the emotional trauma I experienced throughout my life and have been told I am doing very well. I have also been prescribed medication to help with my depression and insomnia. It was not an easy journey by any means, but it is one that I am glad to have started and look forward to finishing. I guess my point would be that no matter how bad the situation you are in may be, remember that the only way it can get better is to keep moving forward. When you choice to end your life you are not stopping the pain, you are merely moving it to your loved ones. I hope this can inspire at least one person to take that first step and find help where they need it. And if you ever feel like you need someone to talk to, feel free to message me. I will always have time to help someone if I can. Stay strong everyone./nSometimes I think I’ve never worked hard at anything...And then I remember I work my ass off every day to stay alive.  Which counts.  I may not be accomplished academically, or have kids or a career, but I’ve made it through all of the times I wanted to end my life.  And that’s the toughest challenge I can think of./nit'll be goodeventually/nFrom dropping out to class average+!!I've always been below class average.  In 2016 by some miracle I got into an amazing university but studying something I hated.  I failed and dropped out my first year in 2017, with not only the lowest scores probably in classes but also failing several courses.  I considered suicide several times especially since I knew my Asian parents wouldn't let me live it down.\n"

      "Flash forward, I started college. I landed myself in a large city where I knew absolutely anyone. I know how to speak to people, but I have too much social anxiety to willingly put myself out there and make friends, so I had no place that I really belonged socially. On top of it all, I was taking 17 credits, I had no life outside of my coursework, and my now long-distance boyfriend had dumped me. All I could do was cry myself to sleep every single night at that point, and that’s when I remember everything going downhill.

I don’t know why she had an attitude with me but, looking back, I think she was mad I didn’t go live with my mom. Anyway, I starting getting depression and anxiety about it. Things kept getting worse and I went down that path you always hear about, skipping school, hanging out with friends instead of going home, partying, picking fights and generally being a mood whenever I did go home. I picked fights with my stepmom just because I felt like it and she even called the cops on me a couple times. \n",

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n"

And I can't just try once and then give up, I have to keep going and  trust that working through the initial discomfort will eventually lead  to feeling better.

Kids used to call me weird, or didn't even bother to speak to me. But in all honesty, neither did I. I couldn't explain it, I just felt off. Scared to talk to anybody other than my parents or my brother. Everybody thought I was just shy, that it will pass. When I was a teenager I developed some serious anger issues. It came ti the point that I considered to hurt my family. I won't write about this part online because I did things that I regret to this day, even though my mom and brother forgave me.  One day I watched tv, and I watched an anime.\n",

I know some kids have bad experiences in residential treatment centers but, FWIW, I got out of it way more than what I put in. Some of that could have been the location and not being stuck out in bumble but for me it was probably better than getting put on meds or going to jail or whatever else I was heading for.\n",
      "At my lowest, I couldn't remember what hope and happiness felt like it. It was as if any remembrance of hope and happiness outside of bouts of depression was just a dream or a drug trip. It was like a word on the tip of my tongue, every time I would start to get a sense of what it was, it would slip away from me. I couldn't for the life of me remember what it was like to feel happy. \n"

He never realizes he is part of that and therefore whatever he does,whatever that is,even if it is the best action(exercise etc) he then will come home and the cycle(slightly modified) will always stay there as long as the thinker is separate from his thought.

      "I also make these decisions apart from emotional hype. You know when you read something really good and you just get overwhelmed with that feeling of wanting to rally and run with it? A lot of people make their big decisions under those feelings, and they don't know why they can't stay committed to things long-term. Often it's because you unknowingly made a motivational commitment in response that strong swell of emotion, so as soon as the emotion dies down so does your resolve and your motivation. Since your commitment was a reaction to the emotion it's easy to think the commitment isn't worth it if the work isn't generating that same emotion.\n",

      "Long story short, I didn’t do anything stupid. They took me to a place called Eva Carlston Academy. At first, it seemed like total BS there because they had all these programs that I had to participate in and I had to live in a house with a bunch of other girls and a million BS rules. Seriously it made my stepmom look lowkey by comparison. Literally every minute of my life was structure there and I hated it. But after awhile I didn’t hate it as much. And then stuff I was hearing in therapy there started making sense to me. I figured out that the family teachers (that’s what they call the house moms at Eva Carlston) were actually decent if I wasn’t being a total brat to them. Yeah, I still think their family meetings are dumb but I got to spend a lot of time in the art room and I learned how to play guitar some (I still remember how to play most of Roar :-D). I started working out too, which I know helped me so much. (I’ve started getting into power lifting at UU but that’s another story) TBH I think the most important thing I got out of my time there was how respect effects peoples lives and how much we all deserve respect and owe it to others. \n",

Half of the time I only brushed enough for my breath to not be too terrible. \n",
      "My grandparents got involved and decided I should go to rehab or whatever (I was NOT using BTW). I won’t say where they sent me first it was one of those troubled teen wildnerness bootcamp BS places in the middle of nowhere. They actually made me clean out horse stalls. YEEHAWWWW. I will write about all that someday but that’s not the important part. My grandma came to visit me there once and saw what it was like, so she brought me back to their house. Her and my grandpa got into a big discussion about it because he wasn’t happy she brought me back from the horse farm. They sent me to a therapist who said I needed meds for depression. When I said I didn’t want meds, the therapist convinced them to send me to another residential treatment program for girls. They agreed to pay for it but they didn’t want it to be too far away this time so they could check up on me more. They wouldn’t tell me where they were sending me but my imagination kicked into high gear. I almost ran away the night before I was supposed to go. This was two months after I my 16th and all I wanted to do was escape my life and whatever hell I was going to this time. I also seriously thought about doing something way worse that night.\n",

Things kept getting worse and I went down that path you always hear about, skipping school, hanging out with friends instead of going home, partying, picking fights and generally being a mood whenever I did go home.

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",

It's extremely effective for many  people, but I have a theory that big pharma would rather most people not  know about it since it cuts into their profits. ECT is more invasive because they put you to sleep, but they are both FDA approved to fight  depression.

I have also been prescribed medication to help with my depression and insomnia. It was not an easy journey by any means, but it is one that I am glad to have started and look forward to finishing. I guess my point would be that no matter how bad the situation you are in may be, remember that the only way it can get better is to keep moving forward. When you choice to end your life you are not stopping the pain, you are merely moving it to your loved ones.

Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too.

Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.

I mostly lurk and see what advice is given and hope its applicable to me, but today I wanted to share the next step in my recovery with everyone. My life has been full of ups and downs, but mostly it has been downs. If you are interested in all that you can check out my first post, because this is going to be a positive one. During my period of absence, I have overcame my alcohol addiction and am proud to say I am 9 months sober. I have started therapy to deal with the emotional trauma I experienced throughout my life and have been told I am doing very well. I have also been prescribed medication to help with my depression and insomnia. It was not an easy journey by any means, but it is one that I am glad to have started and look forward to finishing. I guess my point would be that no matter how bad the situation you are in may be, remember that the only way it can get better is to keep moving forward. When you choice to end your life you are not stopping the pain, you are merely moving it to your loved ones. I hope this can inspire at least one person to take that first step and find help where they need it. And if you ever feel like you need someone to talk to, feel free to message me.

You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",

The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n"

If anyone is struggling with opioid addiction/ knows anyone that is struggling, a Virginia non-profit offers free Narcan (OPIOID overdose reversal medication/ supplies/ training). NO STIGMA. We will ship it to you. SAVE A LIFE! (Virginia only, sorry)It’s no secret that opioid abuse is a growing problem in the United States. An estimated 2.4 million people in the United States abuse prescription painkillers, and almost half a million people suffer from heroin abuse.1 But people abusing opioids also often face the additional burden of depression. Left untreated, this often hidden mental illness can make recovery even more difficult.\n",
      "The relationship between opioid abuse and depression is bi-directional, meaning that suffering from one increases the risk of the other. Opioid abuse is defined as using a prescription opioid for non-medical reasons or using it longer or in greater amounts than what was prescribed by a doctor, and opioid abuse has been linked to higher rates of depression.\n",
      "It stole so many years of my life, so many of my relationships, and got so close to killing me. But that whole time it ran the risk that I might figure out its inner-workings and expose it to the rest of the world. That I might tell other people the weak points and vulnerabilities I found in its system. \n",
      "Giving 100% as a functioning person and giving 100% as a depressed person are *not* the same thing. We tell ourselves that we’re pathetic, weak, and not good enough, when in fact, were fighting harder than the functioning people, it just looks like less. \n",
      "My mother never stressed the importance of seeing the dentist. Of course, she would tell me to brush my teeth and occasionally yell at me when I went multiple days without brushing. Mostly, she never explained to me why it was important or the consequences of neglecting my teeth. My mother was also a drug addict so as I got older, any attempt she made at parenting I rebelled against. As a teenager I didn’t see how my rebelling would only create a definite problem into adulthood.\n",

      "Lots of love to the other fighters out there!/nLET GO vs HOLD ONTO/nAre the words of others getting you down? Take your thoughts captive! Replace them with truth!/nAn update for those wonderful kind people who commented on my last post.Thank you all for the advice and help. I am starting to feel better and even had a job interview that went really well earlier today. The morning after I made that post I decided to go for a walk/run and take a shower and that same day I met a girl and we've been talking to eachother almost nonstop since we met. Honestly if I hadn't seen the amount of help from everyone on here (you're all seriously amazing) I'd still be in the same outfit stuck with no motivation. I know I will fall again and get down but I'm going to try and be better when it happens. I'm sorry I didnt PM anyone of you but please feel free to PM me so I can thank you personally for the support./nThis a great communityI like that we can get together to discuss what bothers us. I've been actively studying the cause of my depression since being your own advocate is always the best. That's why I started my own sub where active research is being posted myself and others like me. Can easily be found through my info. I love the idea of having people like me actively researching themselves to get to the bottom of it, rather than just settle and suffer. My goal is to find the number of causes and put in one accessible area not filled with clutter so that eventually more and more people can get the help they need. I wish everyone the best. Stay positive. It's all about that silver lining. Don't forget, you matter./nSpring cleaning can be a wonderful thing 🌸/nIm feeling great about myself!I have never really posted on here yet to be honest.... Just felt like my imput wasnt wanted, but i have been scrolling and getting motivation from all the wonderful people here... My life was falling apart, my depression changed me so much that my girlfriemd left me, my parents cut me out of their lives all together, and the few friends I had have cut me out as well saying that I'm \"too toxic and negative\". I was at my all time low yesterday and honestly thought it was never going to get better. Today however, I feel like i have purpose, I realized it does get better. I realized this because i finally got a job today as an EMR at the local fire department. I dont feel like a useless waste of space in society anymore, I am better. \n",
      "1. Personification: I am being very intentional about externalizing the issue. It's usually the opposite that's taught. Internalize it, \"accept that it's a part of who you are and always will be.\" If it's a part of who I am, I'm fucked, because I'm always going to be who I am. That means everywhere I go it will go with me. What hope is there to be free, then? But if I realize that it's on the outside wanting to get in, then I can treat it like I would a common thief trying to break into my house to steal my things, hurt my family and kill me. Because that is what these mental health issues exist to do, their only goal is to kill.\n",
      "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on changing the way a person thinks through guided exercises to address the root of aberrant behaviors. A huge part of this technique is first identifying that a problem exists, addressing the problem, and in doing so, hopefully alleviate the symptoms associated with the problem. I am new to therapy, admittedly, but my therapist has already started CBT with me. When my therapist pointed out my faulty thinking and gave it a name, I was able to recognize that this was not normal. Now we are in the process of changing the way I think about myself. It is not something that I expect to happen overnight. It took years of beating myself up to get to the point where I even considered therapy as an option. So, I fully anticipate the great time and effort I’ll need to invest in this healing process. I’ve started by doing more of the things that make me happy, like writing. Writing has always been cathartic for me and helps me organize and recognize fallacies in my thought process. It’s why I started this blog. I’ve written diaries, poetry, journals, articles, short stories, and I think I’m damned good at it (though my cognitive distortions sometimes tell me otherwise). Obviously, CBT is highly personal for everyone. Writing is good for me but might send someone else into a full-blown panic attack. So, I will end here hoping that if you recognize yourself in anything I’ve written here, or even if you don’t but have other concerns, seek out therapy. There is no shame in admitting when you need help. It takes a lot of strength to do this, and I think we probably all need therapy from time to time, because nobody lives a perfect, happy life (and honestly it sounds kind of boring). We all encounter bumps in the road, and when we do, it's important to have the skill-set to respond in a healthy manner. The stigma of feeling like a failure, weak, and inadequate for having to seek out therapy, all of which I’ve held myself, is just that, a stigma. Dispel it, dispel the cognitive distortions, dispel the doubt, and work towards a better, healthier you.  \n",
      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",
      "I'm about ready to just delete her number from my phone and ignore her texts, maybe she'll eventually get the hint. I feel like it's a catch 22... if I keep her number it'll just be a reminder that she only wants to talk when it's convenient for her, but if I delete her and show that I'm upset it'll piss off the rest of my family. \n"

      "When I realized that for the first time, I put my foot down, and said, \"Fuck you, depression! You want me dead so bad. You are trying so hard to get rid of me.

Fuck you! I don't care if I have to feel these feelings and hear these thoughts for the rest of my life, I'm not going to kill myself because I think it pisses you off every second I'm still alive. I think you are tormented by every breath I take even worse than you try to torment me in every breath. I'm not leaving. And do you know what? I'm not just going to continue living, I'm going to expose you. I'm going to go to the others that you torment and I'm going to tell them what I learned about how you work, and I'm going to teach them how to conquer you, too.

Knowing the dark, but following the light, that is how I visualize overcoming depression.

I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",

I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",

      "Back to my current situation with my boyfriend. We’re young. We’re 20 and I’m in college. We don’t want to somehow end up with a child that we could barely take care of. I had an IUD and it expelled itself, so I had to switch to the birth control implant, and it made my depression worse. I don’t believe it caused it entirely, but it damn sure didn’t help it. From then on, things got bad. However, I didn’t feel like I had the option to get it taken out because of my situation. I’m too poor to visit the doctor every few months for new prescriptions due to a high copay and out of pocket expense for filling prescriptions. I have to finish school, and I was essentially out of feasible options, so I had to cope with that dilemma. \n",

      "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on changing the way a person thinks through guided exercises to address the root of aberrant behaviors. A huge part of this technique is first identifying that a problem exists, addressing the problem, and in doing so, hopefully alleviate the symptoms associated with the problem. I am new to therapy, admittedly, but my therapist has already started CBT with me. When my therapist pointed out my faulty thinking and gave it a name, I was able to recognize that this was not normal. Now we are in the process of changing the way I think about myself. It is not something that I expect to happen overnight. It took years of beating myself up to get to the point where I even considered therapy as an option. So, I fully anticipate the great time and effort I’ll need to invest in this healing process. I’ve started by doing more of the things that make me happy, like writing. Writing has always been cathartic for me and helps me organize and recognize fallacies in my thought process. It’s why I started this blog. I’ve written diaries, poetry, journals, articles, short stories, and I think I’m damned good at it (though my cognitive distortions sometimes tell me otherwise). Obviously, CBT is highly personal for everyone. Writing is good for me but might send someone else into a full-blown panic attack. So, I will end here hoping that if you recognize yourself in anything I’ve written here, or even if you don’t but have other concerns, seek out therapy. There is no shame in admitting when you need help. It takes a lot of strength to do this, and I think we probably all need therapy from time to time, because nobody lives a perfect, happy life (and honestly it sounds kind of boring). We all encounter bumps in the road, and when we do, it's important to have the skill-set to respond in a healthy manner. The stigma of feeling like a failure, weak, and inadequate for having to seek out therapy, all of which I’ve held myself, is just that, a stigma. Dispel it, dispel the cognitive distortions, dispel the doubt, and work towards a better, healthier you.  \n",

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",

They agreed to pay for it but they didn’t want it to be too far away this time so they could check up on me more.

      "Cognitive distortion it is essentially a distorted, usually negative way of thinking. Also described as a “…biased perspective we take on ourselves and the world around us…irrational thoughts and beliefs that we unknowingly reinforce over time” ([https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/cognitive-distortions/](https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/cognitive-distortions/)). There are several types of cognitive distortions, but they all have at least these three things in common: (1) it is a pervasive way of thinking of perceiving reality (2) it is always false or inaccurate, and (3) it can manifest into mental health issues. Interestingly, most people don’t even recognize cognitive distortions, I know I didn’t. I had been doing it for so long, it felt normal. And while cognitive distortions are never ideal, for obvious reasons, it’s probably hard to escape them for the entirety of one’s life. The real problem is when this way of thinking becomes persistent and chronic, not just periodic, which can manifest as depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. And cognitive distortion isn’t just a fancy psychology term. This type of thinking can inevitably rewire our brains, making it an interlocked facet of neuroanatomy (brain region) and neurobiology (important processes that occur within brain regions), two areas of neuroscience research I study intimately. In fact, rewiring of the brain is referred to as synaptic plasticity, or the strengthening or weakening of neuronal firing capacity, which largely underlies many psychological disorders. The point is, cognitive distortions can be potentially very dangerous and should not be ignored.   \n",

On my journey, I walked past new strangers, I took a new route, and everything which happened was happening for the first time - I’m now wiser. You are the wisest you’ve ever been and will carry on to be so. That being said, why should you hold yourself to the expectations you gave yourself when you were less wise? Think about it; if a 12 year old comes up to you and said *“You should be married by the age of 30, own this property, have x amount of children, own this type of car and earn x amount of money”* \\- You may think “F\\*\\*k off - what do you know?”. You wouldn't hold yourself to that 12 year old’s expectations so why are we insistent on holding on to some of the expectations we created when were younger? Its okay to have expectations of yourself, however; it’s not okay to suffocate yourself because of them.\n",

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

So now, I've been waking up early, going to the gym, drumming for a while and then working. If it wasn't for my want to be as good as I used to be at drums and get into hockey again, I wouldn't have made the decision to get healthy and also have a healthy sleep schedule.\n",

So now, I've been waking up early, going to the gym, drumming for a while and then working.

On top of it all, I was taking 17 credits, I had no life outside of my coursework, and my now long-distance boyfriend had dumped me. All I could do was cry myself to sleep every single night at that point, and that’s when I remember everything going downhill.

You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.

      "I went to the off licence yesterday and bought some toothpaste. On my journey, I walked past new strangers, I took a new route, and everything which happened was happening for the first time - I’m now wiser. You are the wisest you’ve ever been and will carry on to be so. That being said, why should you hold yourself to the expectations you gave yourself when you were less wise? Think about it; if a 12 year old comes up to you and said *“You should be married by the age of 30, own this property, have x amount of children, own this type of car and earn x amount of money”* \\- You may think “F\\*\\*k off - what do you know?”. You wouldn't hold yourself to that 12 year old’s expectations so why are we insistent on holding on to some of the expectations we created when were younger? Its okay to have expectations of yourself, however; it’s not okay to suffocate yourself because of them.\n",
      "8. LABELING AND MISLABELING: This is an extreme form of overgeneralization. Instead of describing your error, you attach a negative label to yourself: “I’m a loser.” When someone else’s behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach a negative label to him: “He’s a goddam louse.” Mislabeling involves describing an event with language that is highly colored and emotionally loaded.\n",

Especially if you live in areas with low levels of sunlight, or work in a corporate environment, your Vitamin D deficiency could be contributing to depression. \n"

To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

I don’t know why she had an attitude with me but, looking back, I think she was mad I didn’t go live with my mom. Anyway, I starting getting depression and anxiety about it. Things kept getting worse and I went down that path you always hear about, skipping school, hanging out with friends instead of going home, partying, picking fights and generally being a mood whenever I did go home.

That Totem immediately goes from being a secure foundation to keep me grounded in positive thinking to becoming the meteor that destroys my entire house with negativity and insecurity. So I'm using foresight to say, *\"maybe not the best foundation to live upon!* Every time I see that hair-tie from then on I know I risk giving room to think that maybe I’m not really lovable or worth anything, because if I was why didn’t it work out?

You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too.

      "Anyway, I started feeling depressed in high school. I ended up hurting myself plenty of times, and I got caught doing so that’s when I had no choice but to try therapy (and I’m glad I did for the time being). I don’t know what exactly triggered it; I know part of it was genetic as multiple close family members also were diagnosed and treated for it, as well as possibly trauma-based from losing a parent at a young age. I went to therapy throughout most of my high school years to manage it. Back then, it was pretty manageable. It sucked feeling down so often, but at the same time, going to therapy weekly helped me release my emotions in a more healthy way. \n",

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n"

I still have dark days and times with I think I’m losing hope but its way less than before. I still work with my therapist on stuff and I probably always will – and that’s OK.

That Totem immediately goes from being a secure foundation to keep me grounded in positive thinking to becoming the meteor that destroys my entire house with negativity and insecurity. So I'm using foresight to say, *\"maybe not the best foundation to live upon!* Every time I see that hair-tie from then on I know I risk giving room to think that maybe I’m not really lovable or worth anything, because if I was why didn’t it work out?

They agreed to pay for it but they didn’t want it to be too far away this time so they could check up on me more.

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n"

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",

      "Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.\n",

I’m sure other people can relate to this: it’s extremely hard to maintain a healthy relationship while suffering from depression and not getting the proper treatment.

Scared to talk to anybody other than my parents or my brother. Everybody thought I was just shy, that it will pass. When I was a teenager I developed some serious anger issues. It came ti the point that I considered to hurt my family. I won't write about this part online because I did things that I regret to this day, even though my mom and brother forgave me.

At first, it seemed like total BS there because they had all these programs that I had to participate in and I had to live in a house with a bunch of other girls and a million BS rules. Seriously it made my stepmom look lowkey by comparison. Literally every minute of my life was structure there and I hated it. But after awhile I didn’t hate it as much. And then stuff I was hearing in therapy there started making sense to me. I figured out that the family teachers (that’s what they call the house moms at Eva Carlston) were actually decent if I wasn’t being a total brat to them. Yeah, I still think their family meetings are dumb but I got to spend a lot of time in the art room and I learned how to play guitar some (I still remember how to play most of Roar :-D). I started working out too, which I know helped me so much.

Compassion is another step above sympathy or empathy in that it  directly offers support, \"how can I help you?\" Sympathy, empathy, and  compassion may all be combined together such as with, \"I'm sorry you're  feeling that way, I went through a similar thing recently and feel your pain, how can I help?\" Sympathy by itself is not necessarily bad, it  just often comes off as distant even though the person giving it may care a lot.

You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",

      "Medication  wasn’t an entire solution for me, but rather a head start towards being a better me. I think the biggest change in heart I had to wire my brain to believe is that my own happiness is nobody’s responsibility but my own. It’s my choice to make time to take care of my own mental health. It’s my choice to seek help. It’s my choice to go out and do things. I can choose to lie in bed all day being sad, or I can at least make the effort to help myself. It’s a hard truth to take in, and it took me forever to just accept for my own self, but truthfully, if you want to get better you have to somehow take control of your own life. Life is what you make it. You get to make decisions in your life, so don’t let an illness stop you from doing just that. \n",

Seriously it made my stepmom look lowkey by comparison. Literally every minute of my life was structure there and I hated it. But after awhile I didn’t hate it as much. And then stuff I was hearing in therapy there started making sense to me. I figured out that the family teachers (that’s what they call the house moms at Eva Carlston) were actually decent if I wasn’t being a total brat to them. Yeah, I still think their family meetings are dumb but I got to spend a lot of time in the art room and I learned how to play guitar some (I still remember how to play most of Roar :-D). I started working out too, which I know helped me so much. (I’ve started getting into power lifting at UU but that’s another story) TBH I think the most important thing I got out of my time there was how respect effects peoples lives and how much we all deserve respect and owe it to others. \n",

She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too.

While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.  You're stronger than you think you are./nA great and Positive Sunday/nFinally6 moths ago I found back my best friend and I took the bravery to tell her about my depression and about my ptsd\n",

      "I’ve been depressed for about 6 years now. I don’t know if this happened to anyone else, but for an extremely long time, I left it untreated, and then it got worse, and around the same time that it was worsening, I had met this really amazing guy. He’s been extremely supportive and understanding with this illness, in ways that most people can’t be. I’m sure other people can relate to this: it’s extremely hard to maintain a healthy relationship while suffering from depression and not getting the proper treatment. For me, on days where I got low enough, I notice that I may not have treated some of the people who cared about me as kind as I should have, but the fact that he, as well as a few others in my circle, understood and worked with me towards improving shows a lot.\n",

      "Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.\n",

While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.

The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",

That means everywhere I go it will go with me. What hope is there to be free, then? But if I realize that it's on the outside wanting to get in, then I can treat it like I would a common thief trying to break into my house to steal my things, hurt my family and kill me.

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",

      "Long story short, I didn’t do anything stupid. They took me to a place called Eva Carlston Academy. At first, it seemed like total BS there because they had all these programs that I had to participate in and I had to live in a house with a bunch of other girls and a million BS rules. Seriously it made my stepmom look lowkey by comparison. Literally every minute of my life was structure there and I hated it. But after awhile I didn’t hate it as much. And then stuff I was hearing in therapy there started making sense to me. I figured out that the family teachers (that’s what they call the house moms at Eva Carlston) were actually decent if I wasn’t being a total brat to them. Yeah, I still think their family meetings are dumb but I got to spend a lot of time in the art room and I learned how to play guitar some (I still remember how to play most of Roar :-D). I started working out too, which I know helped me so much. (I’ve started getting into power lifting at UU but that’s another story) TBH I think the most important thing I got out of my time there was how respect effects peoples lives and how much we all deserve respect and owe it to others. \n",

In everyone you interact with and those who interact with you, there is no one quite like you, that has the same thoughts, opinions, view, sense of humor, or character, and that makes you individually unique.

I ended up hurting myself plenty of times, and I got caught doing so that’s when I had no choice but to try therapy (and I’m glad I did for the time being). I don’t know what exactly triggered it; I know part of it was genetic as multiple close family members also were diagnosed and treated for it, as well as possibly trauma-based from losing a parent at a young age. I went to therapy throughout most of my high school years to manage it. Back then, it was pretty manageable.

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",

Even if you haven’t personally measured this phenomena; its probable that at some stage in your life you were *told* that leaving food outside means it will go off. You believe this to be real and have no immediate reason to question it. It's not contentious. We can objectively confirm this belief by comparing food in and out of a fridge and checking how quickly microbes and bacteria spread. Some beliefs can be measured; yet some, are more subjective. For instance; *forks*. In China, people believe that the most optimal way to eat noodles in through *chopsticks*. Why is this? Why when presented with a very similar food, people have different beliefs on the best way to consume it? I mean - it's not like spaghetti is massively different to noodles so why don't we largely use chopsticks to eat Spaghetti in Europe or the US? And why aren’t people in China or Japan largely eating noodles with forks? I’ve specifically used this example to highlight that some beliefs aren’t necessarily right or wrong.

Her and my grandpa got into a big discussion about it because he wasn’t happy she brought me back from the horse farm. They sent me to a therapist who said I needed meds for depression. When I said I didn’t want meds, the therapist convinced them to send me to another residential treatment program for girls. They agreed to pay for it but they didn’t want it to be too far away this time so they could check up on me more. They wouldn’t tell me where they were sending me but my imagination kicked into high gear. I almost ran away the night before I was supposed to go.

It’s a hard truth to take in, and it took me forever to just accept for my own self, but truthfully, if you want to get better you have to somehow take control of your own life.

Words are powerful so know how your support influences those  around you, even the slightest change of words can make a major difference in a friend's life./n5 Things NOT To Do When You Are Depressed in 2019!Hi guys :) Apologies if you've already seen this video but wanted to re-post as people are saying it's helping a bit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ6avlLoIOc Peace/nDepression - Feel the awful and do it anyway!!For what it's worth... my advice on how to deal with acute depression and how to stop it being your Friday feeling.

      "Has CBT worked for you? Drop a comment and let me know!/nGetting better and overcoming my \"troubled teen\" challengesI’ve been thinking about this for awhile and I need to share my story of overcoming depression and anxiety. For a long time, I refused to talk about what happened to me when my family decided I was a “troubled teen.” But I’m in a different place now and doing things with my life that I feel really good about. I’m working on a final project in my developmental psych class and learning more about how past experiences change people and shape their adult selves. I went through hell and back and I’m starting to understand how much I grew because of what I went through and the stuff I learned along the way. I don’t want to bore y’all with a big ol long story but here’s the basics. I’m not giving names or personal information about the people who hurt me but I want to talk about the ones who helped me get back on track and literally helped me survive.\n",
      "Depression is the hardest battle I’ve ever had to fight, because trust me, before any of this dramatic stuff happened,  I truly did want to get better, but it felt impossible. I did everything I could. I went to therapy. I made an appointment to see a psychiatrist. I tried to walk outside and workout more. I tried talking to new people. I tried to keep a positive mindset on everything, yet I still felt waves of sadness that I felt were out of my own control. \n",
      "That being said, I’m not writing to you as a person of authority. I am not educated within this field. Some of what I write, is from a place of non-wilful ignorance. Despite my ignorance and lack of deeper level of understanding; I carry on to write because I want to understand. I want to understand because I want to help. I do, however, ask for your forgiveness in advance. I ask that you forgive me  for anything  which I write which has, or may miss the point of what depression for yourself, (not others) really is.\n",
      "Back to my current situation with my boyfriend. We’re young. We’re 20 and I’m in college. We don’t want to somehow end up with a child that we could barely take care of. I had an IUD and it expelled itself, so I had to switch to the birth control implant, and it made my depression worse. I don’t believe it caused it entirely, but it damn sure didn’t help it. From then on, things got bad. However, I didn’t feel like I had the option to get it taken out because of my situation. I’m too poor to visit the doctor every few months for new prescriptions due to a high copay and out of pocket expense for filling prescriptions. I have to finish school, and I was essentially out of feasible options, so I had to cope with that dilemma. \n",

      "I just wanted to share that today is the first day I got back on my antidepressant. It’s been a few years and I thought I was alright, but over the last few months I realized I was spiraling out of control. Not only did I gain 15 pounds, but I started binge eating, crying uncontrollably, feeling hopeless and worthless, and having anxiety up the Wazoo. I finally decided it was time to make a change and went to see my doctor, who recommended I get back on antidepressants. \n",

      "That's it!/nMotivational goalsSo recently, I've been picking up drums again, and I'm a lot worse than I was before I hit a depressive wall. Also, I have to prepare for hockey tryouts nex spring. I've been having troubles sleeping at night before, which kind of sucks, because I can't play drums past 7:00pm in my town, so if I stick to the sleep schedule I did, I wouldn't get any time to drum because of work. So now, I've been waking up early, going to the gym, drumming for a while and then working. If it wasn't for my want to be as good as I used to be at drums and get into hockey again, I wouldn't have made the decision to get healthy and also have a healthy sleep schedule.\n",

Thank you again!/nwatch this before you give up {4K}/nRemember: you aren’t alone and you have purpose.Here’s to the people who want to die. To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",

Logically I understand depression. I have read and research so much about depression I could probably teach a class on it. Emotionally however, it's so hard to escape but yet like my Jobs motto is everyday is day one. As such everyday I battle with this disease. To me that is what depression is a disease that constantly needs to be monitored. While some days are better than others and at times it can feel like the disease is gone. It never really is. I say all of this to hopefully help others realize they are not alone in this fight. To seek help get out of the house or do something at a time when this disease feels like a huge unbearable weight on top your chest. Do not give up hope!

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",

I am starting to feel better and even had a job interview that went really well earlier today. The morning after I made that post I decided to go for a walk/run and take a shower and that same day I met a girl and we've been talking to eachother almost nonstop since we met. Honestly if I hadn't seen the amount of help from everyone on here (you're all seriously amazing) I'd still be in the same outfit stuck with no motivation. I know I will fall again and get down but I'm going to try and be better when it happens. I'm sorry I didnt PM anyone of you but please feel free to PM me so I can thank you personally for the support./nThis a great communityI like that we can get together to discuss what bothers us. I've been actively studying the cause of my depression since being your own advocate is always the best. That's why I started my own sub where active research is being posted myself and others like me. Can easily be found through my info. I love the idea of having people like me actively researching themselves to get to the bottom of it, rather than just settle and suffer. My goal is to find the number of causes and put in one accessible area not filled with clutter so that eventually more and more people can get the help they need. I wish everyone the best.

Just felt like my imput wasnt wanted, but i have been scrolling and getting motivation from all the wonderful people here... My life was falling apart, my depression changed me so much that my girlfriemd left me, my parents cut me out of their lives all together, and the few friends I had have cut me out as well saying that I'm \"too toxic and negative\". I was at my all time low yesterday and honestly thought it was never going to get better. Today however, I feel like i have purpose, I realized it does get better. I realized this because i finally got a job today as an EMR at the local fire department. I dont feel like a useless waste of space in society anymore, I am better. \n",

      "Back to my current situation with my boyfriend. We’re young. We’re 20 and I’m in college. We don’t want to somehow end up with a child that we could barely take care of. I had an IUD and it expelled itself, so I had to switch to the birth control implant, and it made my depression worse. I don’t believe it caused it entirely, but it damn sure didn’t help it. From then on, things got bad. However, I didn’t feel like I had the option to get it taken out because of my situation. I’m too poor to visit the doctor every few months for new prescriptions due to a high copay and out of pocket expense for filling prescriptions. I have to finish school, and I was essentially out of feasible options, so I had to cope with that dilemma. \n",

      "Anyway, I started feeling depressed in high school. I ended up hurting myself plenty of times, and I got caught doing so that’s when I had no choice but to try therapy (and I’m glad I did for the time being). I don’t know what exactly triggered it; I know part of it was genetic as multiple close family members also were diagnosed and treated for it, as well as possibly trauma-based from losing a parent at a young age. I went to therapy throughout most of my high school years to manage it. Back then, it was pretty manageable. It sucked feeling down so often, but at the same time, going to therapy weekly helped me release my emotions in a more healthy way. \n",

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n"

      "I’m so happy that I wanted to share my excitement with someone. But no one else would understand how something so small could mean so much to someone like me. Thank you again!/nwatch this before you give up {4K}/nRemember: you aren’t alone and you have purpose.Here’s to the people who want to die. To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",
      "If you're feeling bad, like nobody cares about you, you need to know that you are LOVED. Love is one of the most beautiful things that exist. Love is everywhere. Love is an energy, so are we. If you feel let down ,or depressed, you need to know that even if you can't see it, love is always there. When your crush hooks up with someone else and she doesn't even know you exist,and you're all sour and sad, it doesn't mean you aren't loved, not even by your parents, Jesus will always love you. If you ever think of suicide, you need to know that you will never solve your problems by vanishing, you must fight for this life,because it is the greatest gift ,even if it seems to be sometimes a burdon, your suffering will be awarded in the afterlife. Never give up. YOU ARE LOVED. There will always be hope. Be strong guys, be strong. Peace./nPatience/nGo Get Help.I'm at the beginning of my journey for healing and health.  Today my wife and I saw a counsellor for our marriage.  We will be seeing the counsellor individually as well for our own personal issues in addition to our marital struggles.  I've never sought counseling in the past though I've been keenly aware that it was needed in my life.  While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.  You're stronger than you think you are./nA great and Positive Sunday/nFinally6 moths ago I found back my best friend and I took the bravery to tell her about my depression and about my ptsd\n",

      "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on changing the way a person thinks through guided exercises to address the root of aberrant behaviors. A huge part of this technique is first identifying that a problem exists, addressing the problem, and in doing so, hopefully alleviate the symptoms associated with the problem. I am new to therapy, admittedly, but my therapist has already started CBT with me. When my therapist pointed out my faulty thinking and gave it a name, I was able to recognize that this was not normal. Now we are in the process of changing the way I think about myself. It is not something that I expect to happen overnight. It took years of beating myself up to get to the point where I even considered therapy as an option. So, I fully anticipate the great time and effort I’ll need to invest in this healing process. I’ve started by doing more of the things that make me happy, like writing. Writing has always been cathartic for me and helps me organize and recognize fallacies in my thought process. It’s why I started this blog. I’ve written diaries, poetry, journals, articles, short stories, and I think I’m damned good at it (though my cognitive distortions sometimes tell me otherwise). Obviously, CBT is highly personal for everyone. Writing is good for me but might send someone else into a full-blown panic attack. So, I will end here hoping that if you recognize yourself in anything I’ve written here, or even if you don’t but have other concerns, seek out therapy. There is no shame in admitting when you need help. It takes a lot of strength to do this, and I think we probably all need therapy from time to time, because nobody lives a perfect, happy life (and honestly it sounds kind of boring). We all encounter bumps in the road, and when we do, it's important to have the skill-set to respond in a healthy manner. The stigma of feeling like a failure, weak, and inadequate for having to seek out therapy, all of which I’ve held myself, is just that, a stigma. Dispel it, dispel the cognitive distortions, dispel the doubt, and work towards a better, healthier you.  \n",

I went to therapy throughout most of my high school years to manage it. Back then, it was pretty manageable. It sucked feeling down so often, but at the same time, going to therapy weekly helped me release my emotions in a more healthy way. \n",

      "A friend of mine is always sympathetic and I didn't really realize until looking up the definition why her words felt so distant and unmeaningful. Know the difference so you can support your loved ones! Empathy  typically provides far more support and healing for a person than sympathy does. Compassion is another step above sympathy or empathy in that it  directly offers support, \"how can I help you?\" Sympathy, empathy, and  compassion may all be combined together such as with, \"I'm sorry you're  feeling that way, I went through a similar thing recently and feel your pain, how can I help?\" Sympathy by itself is not necessarily bad, it  just often comes off as distant even though the person giving it may care a lot.

When my therapist pointed out my faulty thinking and gave it a name, I was able to recognize that this was not normal. Now we are in the process of changing the way I think about myself. It is not something that I expect to happen overnight. It took years of beating myself up to get to the point where I even considered therapy as an option. So, I fully anticipate the great time and effort I’ll need to invest in this healing process. I’ve started by doing more of the things that make me happy, like writing. Writing has always been cathartic for me and helps me organize and recognize fallacies in my thought process. It’s why I started this blog. I’ve written diaries, poetry, journals, articles, short stories, and I think I’m damned good at it (though my cognitive distortions sometimes tell me otherwise). Obviously, CBT is highly personal for everyone. Writing is good for me but might send someone else into a full-blown panic attack. So, I will end here hoping that if you recognize yourself in anything I’ve written here, or even if you don’t but have other concerns, seek out therapy. There is no shame in admitting when you need help. It takes a lot of strength to do this, and I think we probably all need therapy from time to time, because nobody lives a perfect, happy life (and honestly it sounds kind of boring). We all encounter bumps in the road, and when we do, it's important to have the skill-set to respond in a healthy manner. The stigma of feeling like a failure, weak, and inadequate for having to seek out therapy, all of which I’ve held myself, is just that, a stigma. Dispel it, dispel the cognitive distortions, dispel the doubt, and work towards a better, healthier you.  \n",
      "I have motivation , but at the same time I don't. I am currently seeking professional help and it gets better bit by bit. And music helps too. The most important thing is to never doubt yourself, it gets hard, but you will get through it. And also if it gets too much, please seek professional help. It WILL get better :) Even with anxiety and depression, you can overcome it.\n"

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

      "If you're feeling bad, like nobody cares about you, you need to know that you are LOVED. Love is one of the most beautiful things that exist. Love is everywhere. Love is an energy, so are we. If you feel let down ,or depressed, you need to know that even if you can't see it, love is always there. When your crush hooks up with someone else and she doesn't even know you exist,and you're all sour and sad, it doesn't mean you aren't loved, not even by your parents, Jesus will always love you. If you ever think of suicide, you need to know that you will never solve your problems by vanishing, you must fight for this life,because it is the greatest gift ,even if it seems to be sometimes a burdon, your suffering will be awarded in the afterlife. Never give up. YOU ARE LOVED. There will always be hope. Be strong guys, be strong. Peace./nPatience/nGo Get Help.I'm at the beginning of my journey for healing and health.  Today my wife and I saw a counsellor for our marriage.  We will be seeing the counsellor individually as well for our own personal issues in addition to our marital struggles.  I've never sought counseling in the past though I've been keenly aware that it was needed in my life.  While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.

      "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on changing the way a person thinks through guided exercises to address the root of aberrant behaviors. A huge part of this technique is first identifying that a problem exists, addressing the problem, and in doing so, hopefully alleviate the symptoms associated with the problem. I am new to therapy, admittedly, but my therapist has already started CBT with me. When my therapist pointed out my faulty thinking and gave it a name, I was able to recognize that this was not normal. Now we are in the process of changing the way I think about myself. It is not something that I expect to happen overnight. It took years of beating myself up to get to the point where I even considered therapy as an option. So, I fully anticipate the great time and effort I’ll need to invest in this healing process. I’ve started by doing more of the things that make me happy, like writing. Writing has always been cathartic for me and helps me organize and recognize fallacies in my thought process. It’s why I started this blog. I’ve written diaries, poetry, journals, articles, short stories, and I think I’m damned good at it (though my cognitive distortions sometimes tell me otherwise). Obviously, CBT is highly personal for everyone. Writing is good for me but might send someone else into a full-blown panic attack. So, I will end here hoping that if you recognize yourself in anything I’ve written here, or even if you don’t but have other concerns, seek out therapy. There is no shame in admitting when you need help. It takes a lot of strength to do this, and I think we probably all need therapy from time to time, because nobody lives a perfect, happy life (and honestly it sounds kind of boring). We all encounter bumps in the road, and when we do, it's important to have the skill-set to respond in a healthy manner. The stigma of feeling like a failure, weak, and inadequate for having to seek out therapy, all of which I’ve held myself, is just that, a stigma. Dispel it, dispel the cognitive distortions, dispel the doubt, and work towards a better, healthier you.  \n",

Today my wife and I saw a counsellor for our marriage.  We will be seeing the counsellor individually as well for our own personal issues in addition to our marital struggles.  I've never sought counseling in the past though I've been keenly aware that it was needed in my life.  While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

      "Medication  wasn’t an entire solution for me, but rather a head start towards being a better me.

I had an IUD and it expelled itself, so I had to switch to the birth control implant, and it made my depression worse. I don’t believe it caused it entirely, but it damn sure didn’t help it. From then on, things got bad. However, I didn’t feel like I had the option to get it taken out because of my situation. I’m too poor to visit the doctor every few months for new prescriptions due to a high copay and out of pocket expense for filling prescriptions.

This time around, I think I'm going to do my best to stick with this, even when I'm feeling well. Maybe that will make it harder for me to fall into depression. Maybe it'll make me feel more resilient. I took a DBT outpatient program years ago, and I really liked the worksheets, but found that I wish they were a little customizable.\n"

To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you.

I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.

Seeing that smile just made literal years of nothing but stress, pain, shame, and fear lift from my mind. I actually felt *alive* and happy *to be* alive for the first time in years. Everybody functions differently, but for me, this made a huge change. Hopefully someone reading this can make use of what I've said. I'm now in a much better place and if you need somebody to talk to, it would make my day if I could help you./nFinding protective factors against suicide: A research studyHello,\n",

Especially if you live in areas with low levels of sunlight, or work in a corporate environment, your Vitamin D deficiency could be contributing to depression. \n",

The police comes and I get forced into the ER and admitted to the psychiatric ward. If any of you all have been to one of those, you’ll understand that it’s one of the worst places to find yourself. It’s not fun. They take your cell phones and basically all of your freedom. You get the help you need faster, but it’s still a miserable experience. Not only that, but I was scared shitless as there were individuals there that were a threat to me.

Today my wife and I saw a counsellor for our marriage.  We will be seeing the counsellor individually as well for our own personal issues in addition to our marital struggles.  I've never sought counseling in the past though I've been keenly aware that it was needed in my life.  While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.

Yeah, I still think their family meetings are dumb but I got to spend a lot of time in the art room and I learned how to play guitar some (I still remember how to play most of Roar :-D).

Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions.

      "Yesterday I had a deep cleaning with a new dentist in the medical office I work in. She continuously complimented me on my flossing and how well I’ve been taking care of my teeth. It was the best feeling I’ve felt in a while. Depression can make you do the stupidest things. But it’s possible to reverse the consequences. I’m so grateful for pushing through. Recovery is never linear but in this moment I feel like I can conquer anything.  \n",
      "I just wanted to share that today is the first day I got back on my antidepressant. It’s been a few years and I thought I was alright, but over the last few months I realized I was spiraling out of control. Not only did I gain 15 pounds, but I started binge eating, crying uncontrollably, feeling hopeless and worthless, and having anxiety up the Wazoo. I finally decided it was time to make a change and went to see my doctor, who recommended I get back on antidepressants. \n",
      "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on changing the way a person thinks through guided exercises to address the root of aberrant behaviors. A huge part of this technique is first identifying that a problem exists, addressing the problem, and in doing so, hopefully alleviate the symptoms associated with the problem. I am new to therapy, admittedly, but my therapist has already started CBT with me. When my therapist pointed out my faulty thinking and gave it a name, I was able to recognize that this was not normal. Now we are in the process of changing the way I think about myself. It is not something that I expect to happen overnight. It took years of beating myself up to get to the point where I even considered therapy as an option. So, I fully anticipate the great time and effort I’ll need to invest in this healing process. I’ve started by doing more of the things that make me happy, like writing. Writing has always been cathartic for me and helps me organize and recognize fallacies in my thought process. It’s why I started this blog. I’ve written diaries, poetry, journals, articles, short stories, and I think I’m damned good at it (though my cognitive distortions sometimes tell me otherwise). Obviously, CBT is highly personal for everyone. Writing is good for me but might send someone else into a full-blown panic attack. So, I will end here hoping that if you recognize yourself in anything I’ve written here, or even if you don’t but have other concerns, seek out therapy. There is no shame in admitting when you need help. It takes a lot of strength to do this, and I think we probably all need therapy from time to time, because nobody lives a perfect, happy life (and honestly it sounds kind of boring). We all encounter bumps in the road, and when we do, it's important to have the skill-set to respond in a healthy manner. The stigma of feeling like a failure, weak, and inadequate for having to seek out therapy, all of which I’ve held myself, is just that, a stigma. Dispel it, dispel the cognitive distortions, dispel the doubt, and work towards a better, healthier you.  \n",
      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n"

      "Anyway, I started feeling depressed in high school. I ended up hurting myself plenty of times, and I got caught doing so that’s when I had no choice but to try therapy (and I’m glad I did for the time being). I don’t know what exactly triggered it; I know part of it was genetic as multiple close family members also were diagnosed and treated for it, as well as possibly trauma-based from losing a parent at a young age. I went to therapy throughout most of my high school years to manage it. Back then, it was pretty manageable. It sucked feeling down so often, but at the same time, going to therapy weekly helped me release my emotions in a more healthy way. \n",

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

Today my wife and I saw a counsellor for our marriage.  We will be seeing the counsellor individually as well for our own personal issues in addition to our marital struggles.  I've never sought counseling in the past though I've been keenly aware that it was needed in my life.  While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.

You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too.

Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.

The morning after I made that post I decided to go for a walk/run and take a shower and that same day I met a girl and we've been talking to eachother almost nonstop since we met. Honestly if I hadn't seen the amount of help from everyone on here (you're all seriously amazing) I'd still be in the same outfit stuck with no motivation. I know I will fall again and get down but I'm going to try and be better when it happens. I'm sorry I didnt PM anyone of you but please feel free to PM me so I can thank you personally for the support./nThis a great communityI like that we can get together to discuss what bothers us. I've been actively studying the cause of my depression since being your own advocate is always the best. That's why I started my own sub where active research is being posted myself and others like me. Can easily be found through my info. I love the idea of having people like me actively researching themselves to get to the bottom of it, rather than just settle and suffer. My goal is to find the number of causes and put in one accessible area not filled with clutter so that eventually more and more people can get the help they need. I wish everyone the best. Stay positive. It's all about that silver lining. Don't forget, you matter./nSpring cleaning can be a wonderful thing 🌸/nIm feeling great about myself!I have never really posted on here yet to be honest.... Just felt like my imput wasnt wanted, but i have been scrolling and getting motivation from all the wonderful people here... My life was falling apart, my depression changed me so much that my girlfriemd left me, my parents cut me out of their lives all together, and the few friends I had have cut me out as well saying that I'm \"too toxic and negative\". I was at my all time low yesterday and honestly thought it was never going to get better. Today however, I feel like i have purpose, I realized it does get better. I realized this because i finally got a job today as an EMR at the local fire department. I dont feel like a useless waste of space in society anymore, I am better. \n",

That Totem immediately goes from being a secure foundation to keep me grounded in positive thinking to becoming the meteor that destroys my entire house with negativity and insecurity. So I'm using foresight to say, *\"maybe not the best foundation to live upon!* Every time I see that hair-tie from then on I know I risk giving room to think that maybe I’m not really lovable or worth anything, because if I was why didn’t it work out? Why did she stop wanting me?\n",

I guess my point would be that no matter how bad the situation you are in may be, remember that the only way it can get better is to keep moving forward. When you choice to end your life you are not stopping the pain, you are merely moving it to your loved ones.

      "A friend of mine is always sympathetic and I didn't really realize until looking up the definition why her words felt so distant and unmeaningful. Know the difference so you can support your loved ones! Empathy  typically provides far more support and healing for a person than sympathy does. Compassion is another step above sympathy or empathy in that it  directly offers support, \"how can I help you?\" Sympathy, empathy, and  compassion may all be combined together such as with, \"I'm sorry you're  feeling that way, I went through a similar thing recently and feel your pain, how can I help?\" Sympathy by itself is not necessarily bad, it  just often comes off as distant even though the person giving it may care a lot.

I guess my point would be that no matter how bad the situation you are in may be, remember that the only way it can get better is to keep moving forward. When you choice to end your life you are not stopping the pain, you are merely moving it to your loved ones. I hope this can inspire at least one person to take that first step and find help where they need it. And if you ever feel like you need someone to talk to, feel free to message me. I will always have time to help someone if I can. Stay strong everyone./nSometimes I think I’ve never worked hard at anything...And then I remember I work my ass off every day to stay alive.  Which counts.  I may not be accomplished academically, or have kids or a career, but I’ve made it through all of the times I wanted to end my life.  And that’s the toughest challenge I can think of./nit'll be goodeventually/nFrom dropping out to class average+!!I've always been below class average.  In 2016 by some miracle I got into an amazing university but studying something I hated.  I failed and dropped out my first year in 2017, with not only the lowest scores probably in classes but also failing several courses.  I considered suicide several times especially since I knew my Asian parents wouldn't let me live it down.\n",

In everyone you interact with and those who interact with you, there is no one quite like you, that has the same thoughts, opinions, view, sense of humor, or character, and that makes you individually unique.

I don't understand why this unbearable feeling of sadness and anger sprinkled with incredible regret for not having control of my feelings particularly those that make me feel sad or like I am not good enough nor worth enough keep coming up. Logically I understand depression. I have read and research so much about depression I could probably teach a class on it. Emotionally however, it's so hard to escape but yet like my Jobs motto is everyday is day one. As such everyday I battle with this disease. To me that is what depression is a disease that constantly needs to be monitored. While some days are better than others and at times it can feel like the disease is gone. It never really is. I say all of this to hopefully help others realize they are not alone in this fight. To seek help get out of the house or do something at a time when this disease feels like a huge unbearable weight on top your chest. Do not give up hope! Every day is our day one and every day like warriors for those we love the most who will feel our lose if we let this disease win.

      "If you're feeling bad, like nobody cares about you, you need to know that you are LOVED. Love is one of the most beautiful things that exist. Love is everywhere. Love is an energy, so are we. If you feel let down ,or depressed, you need to know that even if you can't see it, love is always there. When your crush hooks up with someone else and she doesn't even know you exist,and you're all sour and sad, it doesn't mean you aren't loved, not even by your parents, Jesus will always love you. If you ever think of suicide, you need to know that you will never solve your problems by vanishing, you must fight for this life,because it is the greatest gift ,even if it seems to be sometimes a burdon, your suffering will be awarded in the afterlife. Never give up. YOU ARE LOVED. There will always be hope. Be strong guys, be strong. Peace./nPatience/nGo Get Help.I'm at the beginning of my journey for healing and health.  Today my wife and I saw a counsellor for our marriage.  We will be seeing the counsellor individually as well for our own personal issues in addition to our marital struggles.  I've never sought counseling in the past though I've been keenly aware that it was needed in my life.  While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.  You're stronger than you think you are./nA great and Positive Sunday/nFinally6 moths ago I found back my best friend and I took the bravery to tell her about my depression and about my ptsd\n",

I think the biggest change in heart I had to wire my brain to believe is that my own happiness is nobody’s responsibility but my own. It’s my choice to make time to take care of my own mental health. It’s my choice to seek help. It’s my choice to go out and do things. I can choose to lie in bed all day being sad, or I can at least make the effort to help myself. It’s a hard truth to take in, and it took me forever to just accept for my own self, but truthfully, if you want to get better you have to somehow take control of your own life.

      "Healing from emotional wounds takes action, but I often get stuck in the  fear or laziness of taking that first step - even though I know I'd  feel way better if I did something. It's good to remind myself that  inner conflicts don't just go away, they require communication, therapy,  totally changing my life by moving or traveling, meditating, finding  forgiveness, eating differently - they require me to take action. I want  to feel good in this life, so I do the work on the road to recovery.  And I can't just try once and then give up, I have to keep going and  trust that working through the initial discomfort will eventually lead  to feeling better. Sometimes multiple conversations are needed,  sometimes switching therapists or trying multiple jobs is necessary -  the healing is there, it just takes effort. \n",

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",

You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too.

Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.

      "Medication  wasn’t an entire solution for me, but rather a head start towards being a better me. I think the biggest change in heart I had to wire my brain to believe is that my own happiness is nobody’s responsibility but my own. It’s my choice to make time to take care of my own mental health. It’s my choice to seek help. It’s my choice to go out and do things. I can choose to lie in bed all day being sad, or I can at least make the effort to help myself. It’s a hard truth to take in, and it took me forever to just accept for my own self, but truthfully, if you want to get better you have to somehow take control of your own life. Life is what you make it. You get to make decisions in your life, so don’t let an illness stop you from doing just that. \n",

      "Long story short, I didn’t do anything stupid. They took me to a place called Eva Carlston Academy. At first, it seemed like total BS there because they had all these programs that I had to participate in and I had to live in a house with a bunch of other girls and a million BS rules. Seriously it made my stepmom look lowkey by comparison. Literally every minute of my life was structure there and I hated it. But after awhile I didn’t hate it as much. And then stuff I was hearing in therapy there started making sense to me. I figured out that the family teachers (that’s what they call the house moms at Eva Carlston) were actually decent if I wasn’t being a total brat to them. Yeah, I still think their family meetings are dumb but I got to spend a lot of time in the art room and I learned how to play guitar some (I still remember how to play most of Roar :-D). I started working out too, which I know helped me so much. (I’ve started getting into power lifting at UU but that’s another story) TBH I think the most important thing I got out of my time there was how respect effects peoples lives and how much we all deserve respect and owe it to others. \n",
      "I just wanted to share that today is the first day I got back on my antidepressant. It’s been a few years and I thought I was alright, but over the last few months I realized I was spiraling out of control.

I finally decided it was time to make a change and went to see my doctor, who recommended I get back on antidepressants. \n",
      "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on changing the way a person thinks through guided exercises to address the root of aberrant behaviors. A huge part of this technique is first identifying that a problem exists, addressing the problem, and in doing so, hopefully alleviate the symptoms associated with the problem. I am new to therapy, admittedly, but my therapist has already started CBT with me. When my therapist pointed out my faulty thinking and gave it a name, I was able to recognize that this was not normal. Now we are in the process of changing the way I think about myself. It is not something that I expect to happen overnight. It took years of beating myself up to get to the point where I even considered therapy as an option. So, I fully anticipate the great time and effort I’ll need to invest in this healing process. I’ve started by doing more of the things that make me happy, like writing. Writing has always been cathartic for me and helps me organize and recognize fallacies in my thought process. It’s why I started this blog. I’ve written diaries, poetry, journals, articles, short stories, and I think I’m damned good at it (though my cognitive distortions sometimes tell me otherwise). Obviously, CBT is highly personal for everyone. Writing is good for me but might send someone else into a full-blown panic attack. So, I will end here hoping that if you recognize yourself in anything I’ve written here, or even if you don’t but have other concerns, seek out therapy. There is no shame in admitting when you need help. It takes a lot of strength to do this, and I think we probably all need therapy from time to time, because nobody lives a perfect, happy life (and honestly it sounds kind of boring). We all encounter bumps in the road, and when we do, it's important to have the skill-set to respond in a healthy manner. The stigma of feeling like a failure, weak, and inadequate for having to seek out therapy, all of which I’ve held myself, is just that, a stigma. Dispel it, dispel the cognitive distortions, dispel the doubt, and work towards a better, healthier you.  \n",
      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n"

You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",

Think about it; if a 12 year old comes up to you and said *“You should be married by the age of 30, own this property, have x amount of children, own this type of car and earn x amount of money”* \\- You may think “F\\*\\*k off - what do you know?”.

Also, I have to prepare for hockey tryouts nex spring. I've been having troubles sleeping at night before, which kind of sucks, because I can't play drums past 7:00pm in my town, so if I stick to the sleep schedule I did, I wouldn't get any time to drum because of work. So now, I've been waking up early, going to the gym, drumming for a while and then working. If it wasn't for my want to be as good as I used to be at drums and get into hockey again, I wouldn't have made the decision to get healthy and also have a healthy sleep schedule.\n",

If a person I was hoping would approve of me doesn’t? I can still say, despite the knot I might be feeling in my chest over rejection, *“You know what?

I know how to speak to people, but I have too much social anxiety to willingly put myself out there and make friends, so I had no place that I really belonged socially.

I’m sure other people can relate to this: it’s extremely hard to maintain a healthy relationship while suffering from depression and not getting the proper treatment. For me, on days where I got low enough, I notice that I may not have treated some of the people who cared about me as kind as I should have, but the fact that he, as well as a few others in my circle, understood and worked with me towards improving shows a lot.\n"

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",

Logically I understand depression. I have read and research so much about depression I could probably teach a class on it. Emotionally however, it's so hard to escape but yet like my Jobs motto is everyday is day one. As such everyday I battle with this disease. To me that is what depression is a disease that constantly needs to be monitored. While some days are better than others and at times it can feel like the disease is gone. It never really is. I say all of this to hopefully help others realize they are not alone in this fight. To seek help get out of the house or do something at a time when this disease feels like a huge unbearable weight on top your chest. Do not give up hope!

They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

      "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on changing the way a person thinks through guided exercises to address the root of aberrant behaviors. A huge part of this technique is first identifying that a problem exists, addressing the problem, and in doing so, hopefully alleviate the symptoms associated with the problem. I am new to therapy, admittedly, but my therapist has already started CBT with me. When my therapist pointed out my faulty thinking and gave it a name, I was able to recognize that this was not normal. Now we are in the process of changing the way I think about myself. It is not something that I expect to happen overnight. It took years of beating myself up to get to the point where I even considered therapy as an option. So, I fully anticipate the great time and effort I’ll need to invest in this healing process. I’ve started by doing more of the things that make me happy, like writing. Writing has always been cathartic for me and helps me organize and recognize fallacies in my thought process. It’s why I started this blog. I’ve written diaries, poetry, journals, articles, short stories, and I think I’m damned good at it (though my cognitive distortions sometimes tell me otherwise). Obviously, CBT is highly personal for everyone. Writing is good for me but might send someone else into a full-blown panic attack. So, I will end here hoping that if you recognize yourself in anything I’ve written here, or even if you don’t but have other concerns, seek out therapy. There is no shame in admitting when you need help. It takes a lot of strength to do this, and I think we probably all need therapy from time to time, because nobody lives a perfect, happy life (and honestly it sounds kind of boring). We all encounter bumps in the road, and when we do, it's important to have the skill-set to respond in a healthy manner. The stigma of feeling like a failure, weak, and inadequate for having to seek out therapy, all of which I’ve held myself, is just that, a stigma. Dispel it, dispel the cognitive distortions, dispel the doubt, and work towards a better, healthier you.  \n",
      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n"

      "If you're feeling bad, like nobody cares about you, you need to know that you are LOVED. Love is one of the most beautiful things that exist. Love is everywhere. Love is an energy, so are we. If you feel let down ,or depressed, you need to know that even if you can't see it, love is always there. When your crush hooks up with someone else and she doesn't even know you exist,and you're all sour and sad, it doesn't mean you aren't loved, not even by your parents, Jesus will always love you. If you ever think of suicide, you need to know that you will never solve your problems by vanishing, you must fight for this life,because it is the greatest gift ,even if it seems to be sometimes a burdon, your suffering will be awarded in the afterlife. Never give up. YOU ARE LOVED. There will always be hope. Be strong guys, be strong. Peace./nPatience/nGo Get Help.I'm at the beginning of my journey for healing and health.  Today my wife and I saw a counsellor for our marriage.  We will be seeing the counsellor individually as well for our own personal issues in addition to our marital struggles.  I've never sought counseling in the past though I've been keenly aware that it was needed in my life.  While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.

      "Medication  wasn’t an entire solution for me, but rather a head start towards being a better me. I think the biggest change in heart I had to wire my brain to believe is that my own happiness is nobody’s responsibility but my own. It’s my choice to make time to take care of my own mental health.

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

      "I just started my first full-time job that will possibly turn into a career as a 22-year-old. I've worked part-time in office jobs while I attended college full-time so I'm used to being able to leave early/not have 40-hour weeks M-F. I'll admit, it has been depressing to get used to in these last seven months I've been here. I honestly feel like I'm wasting my life away in an office without fresh air; a prisoner to the economy, especially while trying to keep my head above water here in costly Southern California.\n",

I went through some horrible things and had to do things to keep myself going. I was clouded by fear and emptyness I just kept tripping and falling g deeper. I then proceeded to try to commit Suicide by OD and failed. Doctor said if I had 5 more mg it would've done it.

Logically I understand depression. I have read and research so much about depression I could probably teach a class on it. Emotionally however, it's so hard to escape but yet like my Jobs motto is everyday is day one. As such everyday I battle with this disease. To me that is what depression is a disease that constantly needs to be monitored. While some days are better than others and at times it can feel like the disease is gone. It never really is. I say all of this to hopefully help others realize they are not alone in this fight. To seek help get out of the house or do something at a time when this disease feels like a huge unbearable weight on top your chest. Do not give up hope! Every day is our day one and every day like warriors for those we love the most who will feel our lose if we let this disease win.

Seriously it made my stepmom look lowkey by comparison. Literally every minute of my life was structure there and I hated it. But after awhile I didn’t hate it as much. And then stuff I was hearing in therapy there started making sense to me. I figured out that the family teachers (that’s what they call the house moms at Eva Carlston) were actually decent if I wasn’t being a total brat to them. Yeah, I still think their family meetings are dumb but I got to spend a lot of time in the art room and I learned how to play guitar some (I still remember how to play most of Roar :-D).

Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.

To me that is what depression is a disease that constantly needs to be monitored. While some days are better than others and at times it can feel like the disease is gone. It never really is. I say all of this to hopefully help others realize they are not alone in this fight. To seek help get out of the house or do something at a time when this disease feels like a huge unbearable weight on top your chest. Do not give up hope!

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

      "Healing from emotional wounds takes action, but I often get stuck in the  fear or laziness of taking that first step - even though I know I'd  feel way better if I did something. It's good to remind myself that  inner conflicts don't just go away, they require communication, therapy,  totally changing my life by moving or traveling, meditating, finding  forgiveness, eating differently - they require me to take action. I want  to feel good in this life, so I do the work on the road to recovery.  And I can't just try once and then give up, I have to keep going and  trust that working through the initial discomfort will eventually lead  to feeling better.

You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",
      "“Worthiness”, is one of such beliefs. It’s an abstract belief we do not actively talk about and have (unfortunately) largely relied on parents, peers, siblings, and strangers to define it on our behalf.  When we don’t meet their \\[and society’s\\] unrealistic and ever changing expectations; - we feel worthless. \n",

If you text that one person you love talking to, but you feel anxious around, know that in that text, you said everything perfectly, and that if they don’t respond, you are still loved! I admire everyone’s courage!! Because that‘s what people with depression are. Courageous. Despite our downfalls, we are courageous! We have the power to step out of the box, we have the power to lift each other up, and we have the power to encourage people who are going through this mess of a life. We have the courage to face our fears and to confront our goals, even when it feel impossible. We have the courage to live EVERYDAY with an illness that affects our brains, but we keep pushing, and we keep trying to do better! So please, don’t blame yourself.  because you are loved, and please keep finding that courage to push forward. Keep finding the courage to remind yourself that you are beautiful. You are a living being who deserves to have their feelings be heard! You have a RIGHT to feel however you NEED to FEEL! If someone tells you otherwise, then please keep pushing to live your best life no matter what they say. There is NOTHING wrong with depression! And tomorrow will be another day that you will accomplish. You will accomplish it by being beautiful, creative, thoughtful, smart, attractive, kind, and most importantly loved.

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n"

Both my brothers went to live with my mom in Idaho but I wanted to stay in SLC, so it was just me and her and my POS dad who was never around back then. I don’t know why she had an attitude with me but, looking back, I think she was mad I didn’t go live with my mom. Anyway, I starting getting depression and anxiety about it. Things kept getting worse and I went down that path you always hear about, skipping school, hanging out with friends instead of going home, partying, picking fights and generally being a mood whenever I did go home. I picked fights with my stepmom just because I felt like it and she even called the cops on me a couple times. \n",

I’m referring to situations whereby we are alone. We spend most of our time alone. I can’t think of any logical reason as to why anyone, in their solitude, would spend time trying to convince themselves against a belief they *already* have. I legitimately believe that *Kendrick Lamar* is better rapper than *Lil Pump*. I have no reason, in solitude, and with no one around, to spend time comparing the two and trying to make a strong argument for *Lil Pump* being the better rapper. I simply wouldn’t do that because my mind was made up a long time ago, and the only time I’ll revisit that belief, is if it comes up in conversation on or offline. \n"

It’s been a few years and I thought I was alright, but over the last few months I realized I was spiraling out of control.

      "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on changing the way a person thinks through guided exercises to address the root of aberrant behaviors. A huge part of this technique is first identifying that a problem exists, addressing the problem, and in doing so, hopefully alleviate the symptoms associated with the problem. I am new to therapy, admittedly, but my therapist has already started CBT with me. When my therapist pointed out my faulty thinking and gave it a name, I was able to recognize that this was not normal. Now we are in the process of changing the way I think about myself. It is not something that I expect to happen overnight. It took years of beating myself up to get to the point where I even considered therapy as an option. So, I fully anticipate the great time and effort I’ll need to invest in this healing process. I’ve started by doing more of the things that make me happy, like writing. Writing has always been cathartic for me and helps me organize and recognize fallacies in my thought process. It’s why I started this blog. I’ve written diaries, poetry, journals, articles, short stories, and I think I’m damned good at it (though my cognitive distortions sometimes tell me otherwise). Obviously, CBT is highly personal for everyone. Writing is good for me but might send someone else into a full-blown panic attack. So, I will end here hoping that if you recognize yourself in anything I’ve written here, or even if you don’t but have other concerns, seek out therapy. There is no shame in admitting when you need help. It takes a lot of strength to do this, and I think we probably all need therapy from time to time, because nobody lives a perfect, happy life (and honestly it sounds kind of boring). We all encounter bumps in the road, and when we do, it's important to have the skill-set to respond in a healthy manner. The stigma of feeling like a failure, weak, and inadequate for having to seek out therapy, all of which I’ve held myself, is just that, a stigma. Dispel it, dispel the cognitive distortions, dispel the doubt, and work towards a better, healthier you.  \n",
      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",

I figured out that the family teachers (that’s what they call the house moms at Eva Carlston) were actually decent if I wasn’t being a total brat to them. Yeah, I still think their family meetings are dumb but I got to spend a lot of time in the art room and I learned how to play guitar some (I still remember how to play most of Roar :-D). I started working out too, which I know helped me so much.

Seeing that smile just made literal years of nothing but stress, pain, shame, and fear lift from my mind. I actually felt *alive* and happy *to be* alive for the first time in years. Everybody functions differently, but for me, this made a huge change. Hopefully someone reading this can make use of what I've said. I'm now in a much better place and if you need somebody to talk to, it would make my day if I could help you./nFinding protective factors against suicide: A research studyHello,\n",

      "Anyway, I started feeling depressed in high school. I ended up hurting myself plenty of times, and I got caught doing so that’s when I had no choice but to try therapy (and I’m glad I did for the time being). I don’t know what exactly triggered it; I know part of it was genetic as multiple close family members also were diagnosed and treated for it, as well as possibly trauma-based from losing a parent at a young age. I went to therapy throughout most of my high school years to manage it. Back then, it was pretty manageable. It sucked feeling down so often, but at the same time, going to therapy weekly helped me release my emotions in a more healthy way. \n",
      "I just wanted to share that today is the first day I got back on my antidepressant. It’s been a few years and I thought I was alright, but over the last few months I realized I was spiraling out of control. Not only did I gain 15 pounds, but I started binge eating, crying uncontrollably, feeling hopeless and worthless, and having anxiety up the Wazoo. I finally decided it was time to make a change and went to see my doctor, who recommended I get back on antidepressants. \n",
      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",

And then I find or create symbols and images that represent those foundations, so a simple glimpse in times of trouble can give me everything I need to remember to stay on top of it.\n",

I will write about all that someday but that’s not the important part. My grandma came to visit me there once and saw what it was like, so she brought me back to their house. Her and my grandpa got into a big discussion about it because he wasn’t happy she brought me back from the horse farm. They sent me to a therapist who said I needed meds for depression. When I said I didn’t want meds, the therapist convinced them to send me to another residential treatment program for girls. They agreed to pay for it but they didn’t want it to be too far away this time so they could check up on me more. They wouldn’t tell me where they were sending me but my imagination kicked into high gear. I almost ran away the night before I was supposed to go. This was two months after I my 16th and all I wanted to do was escape my life and whatever hell I was going to this time. I also seriously thought about doing something way worse that night.\n",

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",

I'll admit, it has been depressing to get used to in these last seven months I've been here.

      "Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others.

      "The most important word of advice I can give on that, is it needs to be something that isn’t based on emotions or other people. For example, I don’t want my Totem to be an ex-girlfriend or even some trinket from a current one (a totem based on the emotion of love). Why? Because feelings and people are generally unreliable as far as being trusted as the overlords of our internal well-being.\n",
      "Equally; when I’ve left food outside the fridge, its gone off. Even if you haven’t personally measured this phenomena; its probable that at some stage in your life you were *told* that leaving food outside means it will go off. You believe this to be real and have no immediate reason to question it. It's not contentious. We can objectively confirm this belief by comparing food in and out of a fridge and checking how quickly microbes and bacteria spread. Some beliefs can be measured; yet some, are more subjective. For instance; *forks*. In China, people believe that the most optimal way to eat noodles in through *chopsticks*. Why is this? Why when presented with a very similar food, people have different beliefs on the best way to consume it? I mean - it's not like spaghetti is massively different to noodles so why don't we largely use chopsticks to eat Spaghetti in Europe or the US? And why aren’t people in China or Japan largely eating noodles with forks? I’ve specifically used this example to highlight that some beliefs aren’t necessarily right or wrong. We just don't question them because they aren't immediately contentious in the societies we are part of. \n",

I have also been prescribed medication to help with my depression and insomnia. It was not an easy journey by any means, but it is one that I am glad to have started and look forward to finishing. I guess my point would be that no matter how bad the situation you are in may be, remember that the only way it can get better is to keep moving forward. When you choice to end your life you are not stopping the pain, you are merely moving it to your loved ones. I hope this can inspire at least one person to take that first step and find help where they need it. And if you ever feel like you need someone to talk to, feel free to message me.

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

On top of it all, I was taking 17 credits, I had no life outside of my coursework, and my now long-distance boyfriend had dumped me. All I could do was cry myself to sleep every single night at that point, and that’s when I remember everything going downhill.

Internalize it, \"accept that it's a part of who you are and always will be.\" If it's a part of who I am, I'm fucked, because I'm always going to be who I am. That means everywhere I go it will go with me. What hope is there to be free, then?

I ended up hurting myself plenty of times, and I got caught doing so that’s when I had no choice but to try therapy (and I’m glad I did for the time being). I don’t know what exactly triggered it; I know part of it was genetic as multiple close family members also were diagnosed and treated for it, as well as possibly trauma-based from losing a parent at a young age. I went to therapy throughout most of my high school years to manage it. Back then, it was pretty manageable. It sucked feeling down so often, but at the same time, going to therapy weekly helped me release my emotions in a more healthy way. \n",

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",

Compassion is another step above sympathy or empathy in that it  directly offers support, \"how can I help you?\" Sympathy, empathy, and  compassion may all be combined together such as with, \"I'm sorry you're  feeling that way, I went through a similar thing recently and feel your pain, how can I help?\" Sympathy by itself is not necessarily bad, it  just often comes off as distant even though the person giving it may care a lot.

Because feelings and people are generally unreliable as far as being trusted as the overlords of our internal well-being.\n",
      ">*First, you cannot earn worth through what you do. Achievements can bring you satisfaction but not happiness. Self-worth based on accomplishments is a “pseudo-esteem,” not the genuine thing! You also cannot base a valid sense of self-worth on your looks, talent, fame, or fortune.

Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too.

I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.

I am starting to feel better and even had a job interview that went really well earlier today. The morning after I made that post I decided to go for a walk/run and take a shower and that same day I met a girl and we've been talking to eachother almost nonstop since we met. Honestly if I hadn't seen the amount of help from everyone on here (you're all seriously amazing) I'd still be in the same outfit stuck with no motivation. I know I will fall again and get down but I'm going to try and be better when it happens. I'm sorry I didnt PM anyone of you but please feel free to PM me so I can thank you personally for the support./nThis a great communityI like that we can get together to discuss what bothers us. I've been actively studying the cause of my depression since being your own advocate is always the best. That's why I started my own sub where active research is being posted myself and others like me. Can easily be found through my info. I love the idea of having people like me actively researching themselves to get to the bottom of it, rather than just settle and suffer. My goal is to find the number of causes and put in one accessible area not filled with clutter so that eventually more and more people can get the help they need. I wish everyone the best. Stay positive. It's all about that silver lining. Don't forget, you matter./nSpring cleaning can be a wonderful thing 🌸/nIm feeling great about myself!I have never really posted on here yet to be honest.... Just felt like my imput wasnt wanted, but i have been scrolling and getting motivation from all the wonderful people here... My life was falling apart, my depression changed me so much that my girlfriemd left me, my parents cut me out of their lives all together, and the few friends I had have cut me out as well saying that I'm \"too toxic and negative\". I was at my all time low yesterday and honestly thought it was never going to get better. Today however, I feel like i have purpose, I realized it does get better. I realized this because i finally got a job today as an EMR at the local fire department. I dont feel like a useless waste of space in society anymore, I am better. \n",

      "Long story short, I didn’t do anything stupid. They took me to a place called Eva Carlston Academy. At first, it seemed like total BS there because they had all these programs that I had to participate in and I had to live in a house with a bunch of other girls and a million BS rules. Seriously it made my stepmom look lowkey by comparison. Literally every minute of my life was structure there and I hated it. But after awhile I didn’t hate it as much. And then stuff I was hearing in therapy there started making sense to me. I figured out that the family teachers (that’s what they call the house moms at Eva Carlston) were actually decent if I wasn’t being a total brat to them. Yeah, I still think their family meetings are dumb but I got to spend a lot of time in the art room and I learned how to play guitar some (I still remember how to play most of Roar :-D). I started working out too, which I know helped me so much.

      "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on changing the way a person thinks through guided exercises to address the root of aberrant behaviors. A huge part of this technique is first identifying that a problem exists, addressing the problem, and in doing so, hopefully alleviate the symptoms associated with the problem. I am new to therapy, admittedly, but my therapist has already started CBT with me. When my therapist pointed out my faulty thinking and gave it a name, I was able to recognize that this was not normal. Now we are in the process of changing the way I think about myself. It is not something that I expect to happen overnight. It took years of beating myself up to get to the point where I even considered therapy as an option. So, I fully anticipate the great time and effort I’ll need to invest in this healing process. I’ve started by doing more of the things that make me happy, like writing. Writing has always been cathartic for me and helps me organize and recognize fallacies in my thought process. It’s why I started this blog. I’ve written diaries, poetry, journals, articles, short stories, and I think I’m damned good at it (though my cognitive distortions sometimes tell me otherwise). Obviously, CBT is highly personal for everyone. Writing is good for me but might send someone else into a full-blown panic attack. So, I will end here hoping that if you recognize yourself in anything I’ve written here, or even if you don’t but have other concerns, seek out therapy. There is no shame in admitting when you need help. It takes a lot of strength to do this, and I think we probably all need therapy from time to time, because nobody lives a perfect, happy life (and honestly it sounds kind of boring). We all encounter bumps in the road, and when we do, it's important to have the skill-set to respond in a healthy manner. The stigma of feeling like a failure, weak, and inadequate for having to seek out therapy, all of which I’ve held myself, is just that, a stigma. Dispel it, dispel the cognitive distortions, dispel the doubt, and work towards a better, healthier you.  \n",

The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself.

      "If my head is full of suicidal thoughts? I’ve already decided in the times of peace that I will stay alive just to irritate the shit out of Death. When it comes whispering in my ear, *“Just roll over and die! You wouldn’t have to feel this way anymore if you weren’t alive! It’ll be over before you know it! People will only be sad about it for a little bit, and then they’ll move on!”* I’ve already decided, *“Whatever you are, you sure seem to want me out of here real bad. I bet you’re even a little pissed off, maybe even scared every second I’m still alive… so you know what? I’m going to stay alive just to annoy you, just to torment you the way you’ve tormented me, just to keep that power over you that you wish you had over me.

      "I just started my first full-time job that will possibly turn into a career as a 22-year-old. I've worked part-time in office jobs while I attended college full-time so I'm used to being able to leave early/not have 40-hour weeks M-F. I'll admit, it has been depressing to get used to in these last seven months I've been here. I honestly feel like I'm wasting my life away in an office without fresh air; a prisoner to the economy, especially while trying to keep my head above water here in costly Southern California.\n",
      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n"

To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.

I ended up hurting myself plenty of times, and I got caught doing so that’s when I had no choice but to try therapy (and I’m glad I did for the time being). I don’t know what exactly triggered it; I know part of it was genetic as multiple close family members also were diagnosed and treated for it, as well as possibly trauma-based from losing a parent at a young age. I went to therapy throughout most of my high school years to manage it. Back then, it was pretty manageable. It sucked feeling down so often, but at the same time, going to therapy weekly helped me release my emotions in a more healthy way. \n",

Why when presented with a very similar food, people have different beliefs on the best way to consume it? I mean - it's not like spaghetti is massively different to noodles so why don't we largely use chopsticks to eat Spaghetti in Europe or the US?

It's not hype, it's not empty inspirational sentiments. It's practical. It might sound weird to other people, but what were they doing to empower me in those times of silent warfare, when I was fighting for my life against things they can’t see, hear or comprehend? So people can laugh at the weapons forged, but the most important thing is do they work? Are they practical? Do they give me the advantage when this enemy shows up to steal my land? Can I teach other people how to wield these weapons too? \n"

The police comes and I get forced into the ER and admitted to the psychiatric ward. If any of you all have been to one of those, you’ll understand that it’s one of the worst places to find yourself. It’s not fun. They take your cell phones and basically all of your freedom. You get the help you need faster, but it’s still a miserable experience. Not only that, but I was scared shitless as there were individuals there that were a threat to me. One guy had to be watched by two people at a time to ensure that he doesn’t try to hurt someone else (because apparently he had a history of that in the facility). \n",

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",

I ended up hurting myself plenty of times, and I got caught doing so that’s when I had no choice but to try therapy (and I’m glad I did for the time being). I don’t know what exactly triggered it; I know part of it was genetic as multiple close family members also were diagnosed and treated for it, as well as possibly trauma-based from losing a parent at a young age. I went to therapy throughout most of my high school years to manage it. Back then, it was pretty manageable. It sucked feeling down so often, but at the same time, going to therapy weekly helped me release my emotions in a more healthy way. \n",

I'm bipolar!! Type 2 to be specific with a tendency toward depression as opposed to mania. That's why nothing was ever working. 30 years of barking up the wrong tree!  Believe me, I was not happy about the news at first: \"What the fuck do you mean I'm bipolar? Have you not been listening to me this while time?\" The signs were there: good grades that dropped way off as a younger person despite ability, a low tolerance for those I didn't like, a very short fuse, overall intensity, crudeness, and so much more. But how would I have known? Everyone else just said I was depressed and a little weird. I never really questioned it. I'm on a pretty heavy mood stabilizer now and have been for a couple months.

You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too.

I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

      "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on changing the way a person thinks through guided exercises to address the root of aberrant behaviors. A huge part of this technique is first identifying that a problem exists, addressing the problem, and in doing so, hopefully alleviate the symptoms associated with the problem. I am new to therapy, admittedly, but my therapist has already started CBT with me. When my therapist pointed out my faulty thinking and gave it a name, I was able to recognize that this was not normal. Now we are in the process of changing the way I think about myself. It is not something that I expect to happen overnight. It took years of beating myself up to get to the point where I even considered therapy as an option. So, I fully anticipate the great time and effort I’ll need to invest in this healing process. I’ve started by doing more of the things that make me happy, like writing. Writing has always been cathartic for me and helps me organize and recognize fallacies in my thought process. It’s why I started this blog. I’ve written diaries, poetry, journals, articles, short stories, and I think I’m damned good at it (though my cognitive distortions sometimes tell me otherwise). Obviously, CBT is highly personal for everyone. Writing is good for me but might send someone else into a full-blown panic attack. So, I will end here hoping that if you recognize yourself in anything I’ve written here, or even if you don’t but have other concerns, seek out therapy. There is no shame in admitting when you need help. It takes a lot of strength to do this, and I think we probably all need therapy from time to time, because nobody lives a perfect, happy life (and honestly it sounds kind of boring). We all encounter bumps in the road, and when we do, it's important to have the skill-set to respond in a healthy manner. The stigma of feeling like a failure, weak, and inadequate for having to seek out therapy, all of which I’ve held myself, is just that, a stigma. Dispel it, dispel the cognitive distortions, dispel the doubt, and work towards a better, healthier you.  \n",

To me that is what depression is a disease that constantly needs to be monitored. While some days are better than others and at times it can feel like the disease is gone. It never really is. I say all of this to hopefully help others realize they are not alone in this fight. To seek help get out of the house or do something at a time when this disease feels like a huge unbearable weight on top your chest. Do not give up hope!

She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too.

They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.

Think about it; if a 12 year old comes up to you and said *“You should be married by the age of 30, own this property, have x amount of children, own this type of car and earn x amount of money”* \\- You may think “F\\*\\*k off - what do you know?”.

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",

They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too.

My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",

      "psychologically the more I try the more i come into a paralysis, the more i think about doing something the more paralyzed,anxious i become so I escape from MY depression and do the repetitive cycle that I have established(which is always the same if you have noticed) and that gives me temporary safety, then I am so tired of overthinking that I havent physically the energy to do something, the energy is wasted by this conflict, the past(thinker) trying to act upon his depression. He never realizes he is part of that and therefore whatever he does,whatever that is,even if it is the best action(exercise etc) he then will come home and the cycle(slightly modified) will always stay there as long as the thinker is separate from his thought.

I ended up hurting myself plenty of times, and I got caught doing so that’s when I had no choice but to try therapy (and I’m glad I did for the time being). I don’t know what exactly triggered it; I know part of it was genetic as multiple close family members also were diagnosed and treated for it, as well as possibly trauma-based from losing a parent at a young age. I went to therapy throughout most of my high school years to manage it. Back then, it was pretty manageable. It sucked feeling down so often, but at the same time, going to therapy weekly helped me release my emotions in a more healthy way. \n",

      "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on changing the way a person thinks through guided exercises to address the root of aberrant behaviors. A huge part of this technique is first identifying that a problem exists, addressing the problem, and in doing so, hopefully alleviate the symptoms associated with the problem. I am new to therapy, admittedly, but my therapist has already started CBT with me. When my therapist pointed out my faulty thinking and gave it a name, I was able to recognize that this was not normal. Now we are in the process of changing the way I think about myself. It is not something that I expect to happen overnight. It took years of beating myself up to get to the point where I even considered therapy as an option. So, I fully anticipate the great time and effort I’ll need to invest in this healing process. I’ve started by doing more of the things that make me happy, like writing. Writing has always been cathartic for me and helps me organize and recognize fallacies in my thought process. It’s why I started this blog. I’ve written diaries, poetry, journals, articles, short stories, and I think I’m damned good at it (though my cognitive distortions sometimes tell me otherwise). Obviously, CBT is highly personal for everyone. Writing is good for me but might send someone else into a full-blown panic attack. So, I will end here hoping that if you recognize yourself in anything I’ve written here, or even if you don’t but have other concerns, seek out therapy. There is no shame in admitting when you need help. It takes a lot of strength to do this, and I think we probably all need therapy from time to time, because nobody lives a perfect, happy life (and honestly it sounds kind of boring). We all encounter bumps in the road, and when we do, it's important to have the skill-set to respond in a healthy manner. The stigma of feeling like a failure, weak, and inadequate for having to seek out therapy, all of which I’ve held myself, is just that, a stigma. Dispel it, dispel the cognitive distortions, dispel the doubt, and work towards a better, healthier you.  \n",
      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",

You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

      "If you're feeling bad, like nobody cares about you, you need to know that you are LOVED. Love is one of the most beautiful things that exist. Love is everywhere. Love is an energy, so are we. If you feel let down ,or depressed, you need to know that even if you can't see it, love is always there. When your crush hooks up with someone else and she doesn't even know you exist,and you're all sour and sad, it doesn't mean you aren't loved, not even by your parents, Jesus will always love you. If you ever think of suicide, you need to know that you will never solve your problems by vanishing, you must fight for this life,because it is the greatest gift ,even if it seems to be sometimes a burdon, your suffering will be awarded in the afterlife. Never give up. YOU ARE LOVED. There will always be hope. Be strong guys, be strong. Peace./nPatience/nGo Get Help.I'm at the beginning of my journey for healing and health.  Today my wife and I saw a counsellor for our marriage.  We will be seeing the counsellor individually as well for our own personal issues in addition to our marital struggles.  I've never sought counseling in the past though I've been keenly aware that it was needed in my life.  While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",
      "We hold a belief about everything. And not in just the traditional sense of religion or politics; but in *every sense* possible. We have beliefs about very mundane words/items such as “chair”, fork” or “fridge”. Our beliefs, and the things which we believe to be true, are created by our surroundings. Life happens at such a fast pace that we often don’t get a chance to scrutinise the sources of those beliefs.  At this basic level, I hold the beliefs that, i) The most optimal way to sit down is on a *chair*, ii) The most optimal/efficient way to eat spaghetti is through use of a *fork*, and iii) The most optimal/efficient way to store food is in a *fridge*. I hold these beliefs because the immediate society im part of has given me tools to test these hypotheses. On large - they have all checked out. For instance; when offered spaghetti and am give western cutlery such as a knife/ fork/spoon; the fork has consistently proved to be the superior means of eating; thereby confirming my belief.\n"

You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.

      "I  have several friends who swear that TMS and ECT saved their lives. They  find traditional therapy of talking to someone for an hour and taking  antidepressants to be useless. TMS is basically a magnetic pulse that  hits the front left side of your brain and rewires the electric signals  in your brain to fight depression. It's extremely effective for many  people, but I have a theory that big pharma would rather most people not  know about it since it cuts into their profits. ECT is more invasive because they put you to sleep, but they are both FDA approved to fight  depression.

At first, it seemed like total BS there because they had all these programs that I had to participate in and I had to live in a house with a bunch of other girls and a million BS rules. Seriously it made my stepmom look lowkey by comparison. Literally every minute of my life was structure there and I hated it. But after awhile I didn’t hate it as much. And then stuff I was hearing in therapy there started making sense to me. I figured out that the family teachers (that’s what they call the house moms at Eva Carlston) were actually decent if I wasn’t being a total brat to them. Yeah, I still think their family meetings are dumb but I got to spend a lot of time in the art room and I learned how to play guitar some (I still remember how to play most of Roar :-D). I started working out too, which I know helped me so much.

      "Let’s say my totem is a hair-tie from a girlfriend, and every time I feel unloved, I look at that hair-tie and it reminds me *“Hey, regardless of what I’m feeling, I know I’m loved because this girl loves me!”* Well, what happens if we have a bad break up? That Totem immediately goes from being a secure foundation to keep me grounded in positive thinking to becoming the meteor that destroys my entire house with negativity and insecurity. So I'm using foresight to say, *\"maybe not the best foundation to live upon!* Every time I see that hair-tie from then on I know I risk giving room to think that maybe I’m not really lovable or worth anything, because if I was why didn’t it work out? Why did she stop wanting me?\n",

I will write about all that someday but that’s not the important part. My grandma came to visit me there once and saw what it was like, so she brought me back to their house. Her and my grandpa got into a big discussion about it because he wasn’t happy she brought me back from the horse farm. They sent me to a therapist who said I needed meds for depression. When I said I didn’t want meds, the therapist convinced them to send me to another residential treatment program for girls. They agreed to pay for it but they didn’t want it to be too far away this time so they could check up on me more. They wouldn’t tell me where they were sending me but my imagination kicked into high gear. I almost ran away the night before I was supposed to go.

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",
      "At my lowest, I couldn't remember what hope and happiness felt like it. It was as if any remembrance of hope and happiness outside of bouts of depression was just a dream or a drug trip.

I couldn't for the life of me remember what it was like to feel happy. \n",

I mostly lurk and see what advice is given and hope its applicable to me, but today I wanted to share the next step in my recovery with everyone. My life has been full of ups and downs, but mostly it has been downs. If you are interested in all that you can check out my first post, because this is going to be a positive one. During my period of absence, I have overcame my alcohol addiction and am proud to say I am 9 months sober. I have started therapy to deal with the emotional trauma I experienced throughout my life and have been told I am doing very well. I have also been prescribed medication to help with my depression and insomnia. It was not an easy journey by any means, but it is one that I am glad to have started and look forward to finishing. I guess my point would be that no matter how bad the situation you are in may be, remember that the only way it can get better is to keep moving forward. When you choice to end your life you are not stopping the pain, you are merely moving it to your loved ones. I hope this can inspire at least one person to take that first step and find help where they need it. And if you ever feel like you need someone to talk to, feel free to message me.

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n"

Even if you haven’t personally measured this phenomena; its probable that at some stage in your life you were *told* that leaving food outside means it will go off.

We can objectively confirm this belief by comparing food in and out of a fridge and checking how quickly microbes and bacteria spread. Some beliefs can be measured; yet some, are more subjective. For instance; *forks*. In China, people believe that the most optimal way to eat noodles in through *chopsticks*. Why is this? Why when presented with a very similar food, people have different beliefs on the best way to consume it? I mean - it's not like spaghetti is massively different to noodles so why don't we largely use chopsticks to eat Spaghetti in Europe or the US? And why aren’t people in China or Japan largely eating noodles with forks? I’ve specifically used this example to highlight that some beliefs aren’t necessarily right or wrong.

All that stuff about how so-and-so loves you, and how all the bad people go one way and the good people go the other? I don't really know how I feel about that anymore. I learned that the world isn't a fair place. Cause if anyone should have died that day, it would've been me; not my baby brother. I loved that kid. I didn't know how much I loved him then. But I do know now.\n",
      "I generally stick with a format/template for a few months, and then when I emerge out of my depression, I find I need it less and less. I eventually drop it, because I don't need it anymore. Then I get depressed again. Then I start up with a new format (I've cycled through about 10 so far) and work my way out of depression again. This time around, I think I'm going to do my best to stick with this, even when I'm feeling well. Maybe that will make it harder for me to fall into depression. Maybe it'll make me feel more resilient. I took a DBT outpatient program years ago, and I really liked the worksheets, but found that I wish they were a little customizable.\n",

And I can't just try once and then give up, I have to keep going and  trust that working through the initial discomfort will eventually lead  to feeling better.

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.  You're stronger than you think you are./nA great and Positive Sunday/nFinally6 moths ago I found back my best friend and I took the bravery to tell her about my depression and about my ptsd\n"

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",

Today my wife and I saw a counsellor for our marriage.  We will be seeing the counsellor individually as well for our own personal issues in addition to our marital struggles.  I've never sought counseling in the past though I've been keenly aware that it was needed in my life.  While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.  You're stronger than you think you are./nA great and Positive Sunday/nFinally6 moths ago I found back my best friend and I took the bravery to tell her about my depression and about my ptsd\n",

      "Anyway, I started feeling depressed in high school. I ended up hurting myself plenty of times, and I got caught doing so that’s when I had no choice but to try therapy (and I’m glad I did for the time being). I don’t know what exactly triggered it; I know part of it was genetic as multiple close family members also were diagnosed and treated for it, as well as possibly trauma-based from losing a parent at a young age. I went to therapy throughout most of my high school years to manage it. Back then, it was pretty manageable. It sucked feeling down so often, but at the same time, going to therapy weekly helped me release my emotions in a more healthy way. \n",
      "Okay! I wanted to share something that really helps me. For about two years now, when I get really deep in the weeds, I start up with a journaling routine. Every night, I fill out a sheet that looks something like this. I make the template with black ink the night before (or several nights before, if I feel like doing a bunch at a time), and each night, I take my colored pens, and fill this form out. The routine is pleasant and grounding, and it helps anchor me to the tools and skills I'm practicing everyday.\n",

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",
      "I've been on a intense journey to recovery for the past month without really seeing progress. And when I say intense, I mean every second has been dedicated to getting better. But all of the steps I've took didn't actually make things better, but rather just prevented me from harming or killing myself. Basically I've stayed in the sattle while still being terrorised. And it never felt worth it, until now! \n",

I only recently found out a way to make everything so much better. It's really hard to hate yourself or hate your life when you make someone happy.

To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",

It’s my choice to seek help. It’s my choice to go out and do things. I can choose to lie in bed all day being sad, or I can at least make the effort to help myself. It’s a hard truth to take in, and it took me forever to just accept for my own self, but truthfully, if you want to get better you have to somehow take control of your own life.

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",

It’s a hard truth to take in, and it took me forever to just accept for my own self, but truthfully, if you want to get better you have to somehow take control of your own life.

Seriously it made my stepmom look lowkey by comparison. Literally every minute of my life was structure there and I hated it. But after awhile I didn’t hate it as much. And then stuff I was hearing in therapy there started making sense to me. I figured out that the family teachers (that’s what they call the house moms at Eva Carlston) were actually decent if I wasn’t being a total brat to them. Yeah, I still think their family meetings are dumb but I got to spend a lot of time in the art room and I learned how to play guitar some (I still remember how to play most of Roar :-D). I started working out too, which I know helped me so much.

Choosing me as a target is the reason the people it's held as prisoners will go free. Had it left me alone, had it poked me once or twice and moved on, I wouldn't know what I know. But it taunted me and intimidated me and bullied me until I was teetering on the very edge of death, and it would have had me plummet over the side, but I realized at the last moment that I'm the only one with the power to make that happen, and the only way it gets its way is if it can convince me to use that power against myself.\n",

      "I mentioned from my experience in high school about hurting myself, and that urge to hurt myself returned yet again. I did it enough times to drive my boyfriend crazy. I was putting weight on him to be responsible for me, and eventually he had to call the police in fear that I’d go too far. The police comes and I get forced into the ER and admitted to the psychiatric ward. If any of you all have been to one of those, you’ll understand that it’s one of the worst places to find yourself. It’s not fun. They take your cell phones and basically all of your freedom. You get the help you need faster, but it’s still a miserable experience. Not only that, but I was scared shitless as there were individuals there that were a threat to me. One guy had to be watched by two people at a time to ensure that he doesn’t try to hurt someone else (because apparently he had a history of that in the facility). \n",
      "Okay! I wanted to share something that really helps me. For about two years now, when I get really deep in the weeds, I start up with a journaling routine. Every night, I fill out a sheet that looks something like this.

The routine is pleasant and grounding, and it helps anchor me to the tools and skills I'm practicing everyday.\n",

      "Sometimes life can feel overwhelming, like everything is too much and you aren't enough or don't want to continue on for whatever reasons, but you have a whole narrative of a life to live and share with others, so much you can do, be apart of and share in. In everyone you interact with and those who interact with you, there is no one quite like you, that has the same thoughts, opinions, view, sense of humor, or character, and that makes you individually unique.

      "If you're feeling bad, like nobody cares about you, you need to know that you are LOVED. Love is one of the most beautiful things that exist. Love is everywhere. Love is an energy, so are we. If you feel let down ,or depressed, you need to know that even if you can't see it, love is always there. When your crush hooks up with someone else and she doesn't even know you exist,and you're all sour and sad, it doesn't mean you aren't loved, not even by your parents, Jesus will always love you. If you ever think of suicide, you need to know that you will never solve your problems by vanishing, you must fight for this life,because it is the greatest gift ,even if it seems to be sometimes a burdon, your suffering will be awarded in the afterlife. Never give up. YOU ARE LOVED. There will always be hope. Be strong guys, be strong. Peace./nPatience/nGo Get Help.I'm at the beginning of my journey for healing and health.  Today my wife and I saw a counsellor for our marriage.  We will be seeing the counsellor individually as well for our own personal issues in addition to our marital struggles.  I've never sought counseling in the past though I've been keenly aware that it was needed in my life.  While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.

I'm not just going to continue living, I'm going to expose you. I'm going to go to the others that you torment and I'm going to tell them what I learned about how you work, and I'm going to teach them how to conquer you, too.

You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much.

I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too.

Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.

      "Anyway, I started feeling depressed in high school. I ended up hurting myself plenty of times, and I got caught doing so that’s when I had no choice but to try therapy (and I’m glad I did for the time being). I don’t know what exactly triggered it; I know part of it was genetic as multiple close family members also were diagnosed and treated for it, as well as possibly trauma-based from losing a parent at a young age. I went to therapy throughout most of my high school years to manage it. Back then, it was pretty manageable. It sucked feeling down so often, but at the same time, going to therapy weekly helped me release my emotions in a more healthy way. \n",

Seriously it made my stepmom look lowkey by comparison. Literally every minute of my life was structure there and I hated it. But after awhile I didn’t hate it as much. And then stuff I was hearing in therapy there started making sense to me. I figured out that the family teachers (that’s what they call the house moms at Eva Carlston) were actually decent if I wasn’t being a total brat to them. Yeah, I still think their family meetings are dumb but I got to spend a lot of time in the art room and I learned how to play guitar some (I still remember how to play most of Roar :-D). I started working out too, which I know helped me so much.

Have you not been listening to me this while time?\" The signs were there: good grades that dropped way off as a younger person despite ability, a low tolerance for those I didn't like, a very short fuse, overall intensity, crudeness, and so much more.

That means everywhere I go it will go with me. What hope is there to be free, then? But if I realize that it's on the outside wanting to get in, then I can treat it like I would a common thief trying to break into my house to steal my things, hurt my family and kill me. Because that is what these mental health issues exist to do, their only goal is to kill.\n",

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",

That’s okay, I’m still a king!”* And you wish them well and move on, knowing nothing about who you are has changed, and more importantly, they didn’t have the power to take any of it away.\n",
      "The same is true for feelings. Not that feelings are bad, but they can be very unpredictable. That makes them unreliable for building sustainable structures on. I don’t want to build the foundation of my identity on how I feel, or on the approval of another person, because I’m not guaranteed to feel that way tomorrow, and that person isn’t guaranteed to still approve of me in the morning. \n"

To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.

Today my wife and I saw a counsellor for our marriage.  We will be seeing the counsellor individually as well for our own personal issues in addition to our marital struggles.  I've never sought counseling in the past though I've been keenly aware that it was needed in my life.  While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n"

Thank you again!/nwatch this before you give up {4K}/nRemember: you aren’t alone and you have purpose.Here’s to the people who want to die. To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",

Her and my grandpa got into a big discussion about it because he wasn’t happy she brought me back from the horse farm. They sent me to a therapist who said I needed meds for depression. When I said I didn’t want meds, the therapist convinced them to send me to another residential treatment program for girls. They agreed to pay for it but they didn’t want it to be too far away this time so they could check up on me more. They wouldn’t tell me where they were sending me but my imagination kicked into high gear. I almost ran away the night before I was supposed to go. This was two months after I my 16th and all I wanted to do was escape my life and whatever hell I was going to this time. I also seriously thought about doing something way worse that night.\n",

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

I really do love you people on this sub. Please find the courage to reach out for validity and encouragement when you need it, you deserve it!

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",

      "If depression sneaks in and lays me out, I can still believe I’m a king, even if I don’t feel like one, even if I'm failing to act like it.

That’s okay, I’m still a king!”* And you wish them well and move on, knowing nothing about who you are has changed, and more importantly, they didn’t have the power to take any of it away.\n",
      "The same is true for feelings. Not that feelings are bad, but they can be very unpredictable. That makes them unreliable for building sustainable structures on. I don’t want to build the foundation of my identity on how I feel, or on the approval of another person, because I’m not guaranteed to feel that way tomorrow, and that person isn’t guaranteed to still approve of me in the morning. \n",
      "Back to my current situation with my boyfriend. We’re young. We’re 20 and I’m in college. We don’t want to somehow end up with a child that we could barely take care of. I had an IUD and it expelled itself, so I had to switch to the birth control implant, and it made my depression worse. I don’t believe it caused it entirely, but it damn sure didn’t help it. From then on, things got bad. However, I didn’t feel like I had the option to get it taken out because of my situation. I’m too poor to visit the doctor every few months for new prescriptions due to a high copay and out of pocket expense for filling prescriptions. I have to finish school, and I was essentially out of feasible options, so I had to cope with that dilemma. \n"

You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too.

Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.

      "I generally stick with a format/template for a few months, and then when I emerge out of my depression, I find I need it less and less. I eventually drop it, because I don't need it anymore.

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

      "I  have several friends who swear that TMS and ECT saved their lives. They  find traditional therapy of talking to someone for an hour and taking  antidepressants to be useless. TMS is basically a magnetic pulse that  hits the front left side of your brain and rewires the electric signals  in your brain to fight depression. It's extremely effective for many  people, but I have a theory that big pharma would rather most people not  know about it since it cuts into their profits. ECT is more invasive because they put you to sleep, but they are both FDA approved to fight  depression.

      "I also make these decisions apart from emotional hype. You know when you read something really good and you just get overwhelmed with that feeling of wanting to rally and run with it? A lot of people make their big decisions under those feelings, and they don't know why they can't stay committed to things long-term. Often it's because you unknowingly made a motivational commitment in response that strong swell of emotion, so as soon as the emotion dies down so does your resolve and your motivation. Since your commitment was a reaction to the emotion it's easy to think the commitment isn't worth it if the work isn't generating that same emotion.\n",
      "A friend of mine is always sympathetic and I didn't really realize until looking up the definition why her words felt so distant and unmeaningful. Know the difference so you can support your loved ones! Empathy  typically provides far more support and healing for a person than sympathy does. Compassion is another step above sympathy or empathy in that it  directly offers support, \"how can I help you?\" Sympathy, empathy, and  compassion may all be combined together such as with, \"I'm sorry you're  feeling that way, I went through a similar thing recently and feel your pain, how can I help?\" Sympathy by itself is not necessarily bad, it  just often comes off as distant even though the person giving it may care a lot.

We can objectively confirm this belief by comparing food in and out of a fridge and checking how quickly microbes and bacteria spread. Some beliefs can be measured; yet some, are more subjective. For instance; *forks*. In China, people believe that the most optimal way to eat noodles in through *chopsticks*. Why is this? Why when presented with a very similar food, people have different beliefs on the best way to consume it? I mean - it's not like spaghetti is massively different to noodles so why don't we largely use chopsticks to eat Spaghetti in Europe or the US? And why aren’t people in China or Japan largely eating noodles with forks? I’ve specifically used this example to highlight that some beliefs aren’t necessarily right or wrong.

Fuck you! I don't care if I have to feel these feelings and hear these thoughts for the rest of my life, I'm not going to kill myself because I think it pisses you off every second I'm still alive.

It’s my choice to seek help. It’s my choice to go out and do things. I can choose to lie in bed all day being sad, or I can at least make the effort to help myself. It’s a hard truth to take in, and it took me forever to just accept for my own self, but truthfully, if you want to get better you have to somehow take control of your own life. Life is what you make it. You get to make decisions in your life, so don’t let an illness stop you from doing just that. \n",

Today my wife and I saw a counsellor for our marriage.  We will be seeing the counsellor individually as well for our own personal issues in addition to our marital struggles.  I've never sought counseling in the past though I've been keenly aware that it was needed in my life.  While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.

This time around, I think I'm going to do my best to stick with this, even when I'm feeling well. Maybe that will make it harder for me to fall into depression. Maybe it'll make me feel more resilient. I took a DBT outpatient program years ago, and I really liked the worksheets, but found that I wish they were a little customizable.\n",

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",

Never give up. YOU ARE LOVED. There will always be hope. Be strong guys, be strong. Peace./nPatience/nGo Get Help.I'm at the beginning of my journey for healing and health.  Today my wife and I saw a counsellor for our marriage.  We will be seeing the counsellor individually as well for our own personal issues in addition to our marital struggles.  I've never sought counseling in the past though I've been keenly aware that it was needed in my life.  While I realize that I'm at the beginning of the road, and that the road will be long and difficult, I'm committed to becoming the healthiest version of myself that I can become.  If you've ever thought that you needed help, go get help.  It can be daunting to find the right therapist to fit your personality.  It can be financially challenging.  Your life is worth the risk.  Your life is worth the struggle.  Your life is worth the challenge.  I train jiu jitsu and I can say from personal experience that in jiu jitsu as in life, you cannot become complete as an athlete or as a person if you do not challenge yourself, put yourself in positions you're not comfortable with, struggle, and work through the tough things to become better.  The first step is the most difficult.  As my trainer says:  white belt is the most difficult belt to get.  You have to start.  A black belt is a white belt that never quit.  I plan to be a black belt in mental health and marital health.  I'm not going to quit on me or my wife or our son.  Don't quit on yourself.  Take the first step.  You're stronger than you think you are./nA great and Positive Sunday/nFinally6 moths ago I found back my best friend and I took the bravery to tell her about my depression and about my ptsd\n",

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n"

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",

To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",

Good support for women of all ages and personal struggles./nYears ago I was diagnosed with depression and severe anxietyI always thought that I was an outcast, since middle school. Kids used to call me weird, or didn't even bother to speak to me. But in all honesty, neither did I. I couldn't explain it, I just felt off. Scared to talk to anybody other than my parents or my brother. Everybody thought I was just shy, that it will pass. When I was a teenager I developed some serious anger issues. It came ti the point that I considered to hurt my family. I won't write about this part online because I did things that I regret to this day, even though my mom and brother forgave me.  One day I watched tv, and I watched an anime.\n",

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n"

She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back.

I guess my point would be that no matter how bad the situation you are in may be, remember that the only way it can get better is to keep moving forward. When you choice to end your life you are not stopping the pain, you are merely moving it to your loved ones. I hope this can inspire at least one person to take that first step and find help where they need it. And if you ever feel like you need someone to talk to, feel free to message me. I will always have time to help someone if I can. Stay strong everyone./nSometimes I think I’ve never worked hard at anything...And then I remember I work my ass off every day to stay alive.  Which counts.  I may not be accomplished academically, or have kids or a career, but I’ve made it through all of the times I wanted to end my life.  And that’s the toughest challenge I can think of./nit'll be goodeventually/nFrom dropping out to class average+!!I've always been below class average.  In 2016 by some miracle I got into an amazing university but studying something I hated.  I failed and dropped out my first year in 2017, with not only the lowest scores probably in classes but also failing several courses.  I considered suicide several times especially since I knew my Asian parents wouldn't let me live it down.\n"

I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.\n"

      "That's it!/nMotivational goalsSo recently, I've been picking up drums again, and I'm a lot worse than I was before I hit a depressive wall. Also, I have to prepare for hockey tryouts nex spring. I've been having troubles sleeping at night before, which kind of sucks, because I can't play drums past 7:00pm in my town, so if I stick to the sleep schedule I did, I wouldn't get any time to drum because of work. So now, I've been waking up early, going to the gym, drumming for a while and then working. If it wasn't for my want to be as good as I used to be at drums and get into hockey again, I wouldn't have made the decision to get healthy and also have a healthy sleep schedule.\n"

      "Ok, so that's established, my first individual session was today.  Over the past couple of weeks since our separation I've had an inordinate amount of time to ruminate on my issues and the roots of my depression, as well as take some proactive steps to start down the path of health.  One of the things I did was start training jiu jitsu (something I've wanted to do for about 15 years).  I also have started actively forming real connections with my co-workers.  Trying to form friendships with them outside of work.  I've also started meeting with my pastor (who is also my boss for my part-time job) on a 'friend' level.  We get together, have a drink, smoke a pipe like Gandalf, and just shoot the breeze.  I've also as stated narrowed in focus on my issues:  a shifting personal identity, low/no self esteem/self worth, self destructive personal abuse in the way of self-flagellating when I make mistakes, and many other things.  In speaking with my therapist at the end of our session I asked her what she'd like me to work on until our next meeting.  She said that with all I'm doing she doesn't want to add to my plate.  She said that she thinks I've taken great action steps to get healthy.  She said that when we first spoke in a couples session last week that she was very worried for my well-being, but that after speaking with me one-on-one that she thinks I'm in a much better place than she first thought.  She said she was very encouraged by where I am.  The said that in her experience there are 3 types of people who come to therapy:  1-just wants to vent.  They want to just have her sit there for them to tell her their issues and not respond.  They typically are waiting on the world outside to change for their situation to better.  2-just wants to talk a bit and listen to her advice, but again is waiting for something else to change and don't put much effort into personal change.  3-is where she sees me.  Someone who will vent their frustrations, listen to her advice, and diligently take actionable steps to create change from the inside out.  \n",

It’s not fun. They take your cell phones and basically all of your freedom. You get the help you need faster, but it’s still a miserable experience.

      "I’m so happy that I wanted to share my excitement with someone. But no one else would understand how something so small could mean so much to someone like me. Thank you again!/nwatch this before you give up {4K}/nRemember: you aren’t alone and you have purpose.Here’s to the people who want to die. To the people who firmly believe that it doesn’t get better, who would rather die than to be in a constant state of pain. Who are so broken that feel like there is no way out. I feel for you. You might think that no one understands, that no one cares or wouldn’t miss you when you’re gone. But i will. I will care. I understand. I’ve been in that spot so much. (This is where it gets personal) I’ve put a blade to my throat but didn’t move it. Instead I dropped it and sobbed. I know what it’s like to feel your heart shatter. I know what it’s like to feel like you’d be better off dead. I’ve watched the blade drag across my skin a countless number of times. I know what that addiction feels like. I’ve written the note before, I’ve had a plan. I understand. I’ve felt so worthless in my life. I know what if feels like to think that no one cares. But imagine this. You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n"

      "What are you grateful for?/nCognitive Distortions: A Serious DiscussionMy therapy session today was interesting. I became uncomfortably aware at how negative I am towards myself. Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",

      "Back to my current situation with my boyfriend. We’re young. We’re 20 and I’m in college. We don’t want to somehow end up with a child that we could barely take care of. I had an IUD and it expelled itself, so I had to switch to the birth control implant, and it made my depression worse. I don’t believe it caused it entirely, but it damn sure didn’t help it. From then on, things got bad. However, I didn’t feel like I had the option to get it taken out because of my situation. I’m too poor to visit the doctor every few months for new prescriptions due to a high copay and out of pocket expense for filling prescriptions. I have to finish school, and I was essentially out of feasible options, so I had to cope with that dilemma. \n",

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",

      "Long story short, I didn’t do anything stupid. They took me to a place called Eva Carlston Academy. At first, it seemed like total BS there because they had all these programs that I had to participate in and I had to live in a house with a bunch of other girls and a million BS rules. Seriously it made my stepmom look lowkey by comparison. Literally every minute of my life was structure there and I hated it. But after awhile I didn’t hate it as much. And then stuff I was hearing in therapy there started making sense to me. I figured out that the family teachers (that’s what they call the house moms at Eva Carlston) were actually decent if I wasn’t being a total brat to them. Yeah, I still think their family meetings are dumb but I got to spend a lot of time in the art room and I learned how to play guitar some (I still remember how to play most of Roar :-D). I started working out too, which I know helped me so much.

I think the biggest change in heart I had to wire my brain to believe is that my own happiness is nobody’s responsibility but my own. It’s my choice to make time to take care of my own mental health. It’s my choice to seek help. It’s my choice to go out and do things. I can choose to lie in bed all day being sad, or I can at least make the effort to help myself. It’s a hard truth to take in, and it took me forever to just accept for my own self, but truthfully, if you want to get better you have to somehow take control of your own life. Life is what you make it. You get to make decisions in your life, so don’t let an illness stop you from doing just that. \n",
      "I also make these decisions apart from emotional hype. You know when you read something really good and you just get overwhelmed with that feeling of wanting to rally and run with it? A lot of people make their big decisions under those feelings, and they don't know why they can't stay committed to things long-term. Often it's because you unknowingly made a motivational commitment in response that strong swell of emotion, so as soon as the emotion dies down so does your resolve and your motivation. Since your commitment was a reaction to the emotion it's easy to think the commitment isn't worth it if the work isn't generating that same emotion.\n",
      "I think that's about the point I knew I had a choice to make. Either I was going to figure out how to beat thing, or it was going to torment me for the rest of my life, and possibly talk me into ending my life way too early.\n"

You finally do kill yourself with a bottle of pills. Your mom calls you down for dinner but there’s no response so she sends your sister up to get you. You hear your sister scream, “Mommy! She won’t wake up!” Your mom sprints up the stairs to see your lifeless body. She sees the empty pill bitten that’s fallen out of your hand. She starts sobbing. Crying hysterically. Your dad comes up the stairs and tired to shake you awake. He does everything in his power to wake you but you won’t wake up. It’s too late and you’re gone. He gets so angry that he punches the wall. A flood of emotions spill out of him. He takes your mom and sister into his arms and hugs them so tight because they know you’re never coming back. They call 911, and they come and carry your lifeless body out. The next day at school they announce your death. Everyone’s eyes go wide and just stare. No body can believe that what showed on the outside to be a very happy girl took her own life. Your best friend runs out, goes to the bathroom and physically beats herself up. The nearest teacher hears her screaming and she goes in and hugs her, she tries to calm her but fails. She lies awake each night unable to be at rest knowing that if she just would have spoken up, you would still be here. Your boyfriend puts him self in a mental hospital so he can’t hurt himself. The girls who leave you out everyday blame themselves. They will never live that down. Your dog waits for you to come home from school, but you never show up to greet him again he’s left in confusion. Nothing is ever the same. You sister now doesn’t have a big sister to look up too. Whenever someone mentions your name she just breaks down. So here’s to the people who want to end their pain, and just end it all. It gets better I promise you. You are strong, you are worthy, you have a purpose. I promise you. Stay alive./nLooking UpI love music.  Like, not just a little bit the way most people 'love' music.  I've been practically addicted to music since before I can even remember.  My parents' vinyl collection was my introduction to the world of music and I've been hooked since I first dropped a needle on vinyl, heard the warm scratching sounds come from the speaker, and then the lush tones of real music.  Music has an enormous place in my life.  I'm sure I'm not the only one here that feels that way.  One of my favorite bands is a little band from Seattle called 'Citizens & Saints'.  They have a new album coming out next month and I just heard the lead single from it.  It's called 'Looking Up'.  It PERFECTLY captures a lot of what my road with depression has felt like for most of my life.  The lyrics are below, as well as a link to the video.  Its incredibly cheesy, but the words...the words are so so good.  I'm coming out of the clouds in my fight with depression after over 30 years of battle.  I hope this song shines a little light in your worlds today.\n",

For context, I do not look at this subreddit or r\\_depression very often, nor have I ever posted on either one until now, but after years and years of differing traumatic events, personal challenges, isolation and loneliness that have marred and if not matched all the great successes and happiness I've experienced in my life, I've come to learn the hard way that the battle against depression is one that shouldn't be fought alone. The fight against depression is one that should be shared in tandem with others to help you, even guide yourself, to fight and persevere for you even when you do not feel you are capable of such yourself. With that being said, this is something I am still very much working on myself and in the spirit of those words, I have decide to share the core aspects of what I had reached out with to the aforementioned Redditor in this post in hopes the thoughts/ insights provided may help and aide others, be some sort of source and means of connection, encouragement and inspiration to remember that there is more than just the pain you may feel at a given time, that you are more than the cynical and criticizing thoughts that may reside in your head as they have been to me and that all of such is all that you will ever know or experience. \n",

I had an IUD and it expelled itself, so I had to switch to the birth control implant, and it made my depression worse. I don’t believe it caused it entirely, but it damn sure didn’t help it. From then on, things got bad. However, I didn’t feel like I had the option to get it taken out because of my situation. I’m too poor to visit the doctor every few months for new prescriptions due to a high copay and out of pocket expense for filling prescriptions. I have to finish school, and I was essentially out of feasible options, so I had to cope with that dilemma. \n"

Which is ironic, because I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist. But I’m only optimistic about other people, about the world, about the universe. I’m a pessimist on all things related to self. I can see the good in the moving parts of the world around me, but when I look inside, all I see is failure, doubt, uncertainty, and an inherent sadness that has been with me so long, I believed it was normal. I hold myself to such an absurd degree of accountability and culpability, simultaneously, that I cripple any hope of appreciating the positive things about myself. Even as I walked out of her office, I started to apologize. It’s so a part of who I am. My exact thoughts were, “I’ve said too much. She thinks I’m crazy. Well, I am, aren’t I? That’s what I get for being vulnerable. She saw that ugly thing that I keep locked away.” I thought them without even realizing I was thinking them, until she said, “you’re doing it again.” And I was. There was term she used to describe the way I think. Which just goes to show the amazing power of language. Once I knew the term, I felt a sense of relief, because now I could investigate, well, myself, my psyche. Cognitive distortion is what she called it. I looked it up, and it wasn’t pretty. But I needed to understand it so that I could start to address it. The most striking description of cognitive distortion: “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” It makes sense. When I apologized to my therapist, I was apologizing because of my own distorted perception: I don’t like me, ergo, she doesn’t like me. I projected my negativity outwardly and imagined her thoughts, when in reality, I have no clue how she perceived me, and furthermore, even if I did, why does that make me feel so uncomfortable? I can only figure that my faulty projection of reality holds a mirror up to myself, and I hate mirrors, both metaphorically and literally. I don’t like looking at myself because I know where my mind will go, the worst self-critique imaginable. And now we’ve made it full circle back to, “negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.” So today, we’re going to get into the psychology behind cognitive distortions. I’m doing this partly for myself, to bravely face that mirror, and to challenge others who think like me to recognize it and do the same.\n",
